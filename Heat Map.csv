BOTTOM LINE: Joe Mixon is a mouthwatering RB 1 play in this terrific game script and way-too-good-to-be-true matchup.

🔵 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Texans have a solid implied point total of 24 points, tied for the 11th most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. You want exposure to this offense.

- The Texans are 4.5 point road favorites, suggesting a neutral-positive game script and balanced offensive approach.

🔵 JOE MIXON:
- Averaging an ELITE 21.1 PPR points per game after 9 games in a Texans uniform, handling 23.1 touches—including 2.6 catches on 3.8 targets—for 112.4 scrimmage yards and 1.2 TDs (11 total)

- Scored 16 or more PPR points in 7 of 9 games (77.8%), including 23 or more PPR points in 5 of 9 games (55.6%) with a high of 35.3 in week 11.

🔵 JAX VS RB:
- Hemorrhaging the 2nd most PPR points per game to RBs, including the 3rd most touches, 4th most scrimmage yards and 2nd most TDs from scrimmage

- Vulnerable on the ground: Allowing the 12th most rushing yards and 5th most rushing TDs

- Mouthwatering matchup through the air: Allowing the 5th most catches, 3rd most receiving yards and 3rd most receiving TDs

- 10 RBs in 11 games have scored at least 15 PPR points against the Jaguars despite just 9 RBs handling 15 or more touches

- 5 RBs in 11 games have scored at least 20 PPR points against the Jaguars despite just 3 RBs handling 20 or more touches

- BUT...if you removed all receiving stats, then just 5 RBs have scored even just 10 points against the Jags. Wild.

- 4 RBs in the last 6 games have scored 21 or more PPR points against the Jags

- 3 RBs in the last 4 games have scored at least 24 PPR points against the Jags

- Games played: 11
- RBs who handled 10 or more touches: 12
- RBs who scored 10 or more PPR points: 12
- RBs who handled 15 or more touches: 9
- RBs who scored 15 or more PPR points: 10
- RBs who handled 20 or more touches: 3
- RBs who scored 20 or more PPR points: 5
- RBs who handled 30 or more touches: 1
- RBs who scored 30 or more PPR points: 1

- HIT: De'Von Achane, James Cook, Dare Ogunbowale, Trey Sermon, D'Andre Swift, JaMycal Hasty, Josh Jacobs, Saquon Barkley, Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery

- MISS: D'Onta Foreman, Cam Akers, Aaron Jones, Cam Akers again",,1,DET,RB,"🟢 David Montgomery

BOTTOM LINE: David Montgomery is high upside RB 1/2 play in this terrific game script and above-average matchup vs the team that drafted him, albeit with some added risk thanks to his shoulder injury.

🔵 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Lions have a mouthwatering implied point total of 29.5 points, the MOST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is THE offense you want exposure to in your week 12 lineups.

- The Lions are dominant 10.5 point home favorites, a wide spread that suggests a blowout win and supremely positive game script that *should* create a run-heavy approach as the Lions are trying to kill the clock in the 2nd half. It raises the potential rushing volume of Lions' ball carriers while potentially lessening the target potential for Lions' pass catchers.

🟢 DAVID MONTGOMERY:
- Dealing with a shoulder injury that knocked him out of week 12 and *could* limit his touches and effectiveness in week 13. There's some added risk here.

- Averaging 16.1 PPR points per game after 11 games, handling 15.4 touches per game—including 2.2 catches on 2.4 targets—for 79.4 scrimmage yards and 1.0 TDs (11 total)

- Scored 15 or more PPR points in 7 of 11 games (63.6%), including 3 games over 21 with a high of 24.5

- At worst, he's landed between 10-13 PPR points in 4 of 11 games (36.4%)

🟡 CAREER VS CHICAGO:
- Averaging 14.65 PPR points on 13.5 touches per game after 2 games against his former team last year.

- Scored 17.8 PPR points on 14 touches in week 11 last year, followed by 11.5 PPR points on 13 touches a few weeks later in week 14.

🟡 CHI VS RB:
- Allowing the 12th most PPR points per game to enemy RBs, including the 15th most touches, 11th most scrimmage yards, and 15th most RB TDs.

- Vulnerable on the ground: Allowing the 8th most rushing yards and 8th most rushing TDs

- Stingey(ish) through the air: Allowing the 16th most catches but holding RBs to the 9th fewest receiving yards and NO receiving TDs.

- 7 RBs in 11 games have been able to reach 16 PPR points against the Bears, including 4 that went past 20.

- Games played: 11
- RBs who handled 10 or more touches: 10
- RBs who scored 10 or more PPR points: 9
- RBs who handled 15 or more touches: 9
- RBs who scored 15 or more PPR points: 7
- RBs who handled 20 or more touches: 6
- RBs who scored 20 or more PPR points: 4

- HIT: Tony Pollard, Jonathan Taylor, Kyren Williams, Chuba Hubbard, Cardinals RBs, Josh Jacobs, Aaron Jones

- MISS: Brian Robinson, Rhamondre Stevenson",,1,CHI,WR,"🟢 DJ Moore

BOTTOM LINE: DJ Moore is an ascending, higher end WR 3 with some matchup and game script (pass heavy) based appeal in week 13.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Bears have a grossly low implied point total of just 19 points, tied for the 4th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Lions defense than one to heavily invest in with your week 13 lineups.

- The Bears are pathetic 10.5 point road underdogs, a dangerously wide spread that suggests a blowout loss and severely negative game script that will press the Bears into a(nother) pass-heavy approach if they fall behind. It puts rushing volume at risk for Bears' ball carriers while raising the target potential of Bears' pass catchers. Expect another 40+ passing attempts from Caleb Williams here.

🟡📈 DJ MOORE:
- Scored 13.7 PPR points on 7 targets in his first game with new Offensive Coordinator Thomas Brown, and 24.9 PPR points on 7 targets in his second game under Brown.

- 14 targets/catches for 186 scrimmage yards and 1 TD (19.3 PPR points per game) under Brown so far.

- Now averaging 12.6 PPR points per game on the full 11 game season, including 7.3 targets, 4.9 catches, 51.5 yards and 0.4 TDs (4 total)

- Scored 15 or more PPR points in 3 of 11 games (27.3%), including 2 games over 24 with a high of 27.5

- Scored between 10-14 PPR points in 4 of 11 games (36.4%)

- Scored fewer than 8 PPR points in 4 of 11 games (36.4%)

🔵 DET VS WR:
- Hemorrhaging the 4th most PPR points per game to WRs, including the MOST catches and 2nd most yards per game

- Yet somehow holding WRs to the 4th fewest TDs.

- Allowing 15.27(!) catches and 187.18(!) yards per game yet somehow holding WRs to just 0.55 TDs per game, the Lions defense is bound to be on the wrong end of touchdown regression sooner or later.

- 10 WRs in 11 games have scored 15 or more PPR points against the Lions, including 4 that scored 21 or more.

- HIT: Cooper Kupp, Chris Godwin, Marvin Harrison, DK Metcalf, CeeDee Lamb, Justin Jefferson, Calvin Ridley, Jayden Reed, John Metchie, Michael Pittman

- MISS: Mike Evans, Jordan Addison, Romeo Doubs, Tank Dell, Brian Thomas",,1,CHI,QB,"🟠 Caleb Williams

BOTTOM LINE: Caleb Williams is an ascending QB 2, but this is a brutal matchup and a bad implied point total. He's not a recommended play.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Bears have a grossly low implied point total of just 19 points, tied for the 4th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Lions defense than one to heavily invest in with your week 13 lineups.

- The Bears are pathetic 10.5 point road underdogs, a dangerously wide spread that suggests a blowout loss and severely negative game script that will press the Bears into a(nother) pass-heavy approach if they fall behind. It puts rushing volume at risk for Bears' ball carriers while raising the target potential of Bears' pass catchers. Expect another 40+ passing attempts from Caleb Williams here.

🟡📈 CALEB WILLIAMS:
- Averaging an encouraging 20.6 fantasy points per game after 2 games under new Offensive Coordinator Thomas Brown.

- Scored 16.24 points in week 11 and then 24.9 fantasy points in week 12, the 2nd best game of his young career.

- Now averaging 14.7 fantasy points per game after 11 games, including 33.8 passing attempts, 214.2 passing yards, 1.0 passing TDs (11 total), 0.5 INTs (5 total) and 30.3 scoreless rushing yards.

- Scored 16 or more fantasy points in 5 of 11 games (45.5%), including 3 games over 23 with a high of 28.64

- Also scored fewer than 10 fantasy points in 5 of 11 games (45.5%), including a low 5.22

🔴 DET VS QB:
- Holding QBs to the 4th fewest fantasy points per game (13.17), including the FEWEST TD passes

- That said, they ARE allowing the 7th most passing yards, 12th most rushing yards and 14th most rushing TDs

- Allowing 242.55 passing yards but just 0.64 passing TDs per game, the Lions defense is bound to be on the wrong end of touchdown regression sooner or later

- Just 4 QBs in 11 game have been able to reach 15 fantasy points against the Lions, just 1 of which was able to pass 20 for a high of 21.6.

- Each of the last 4 QBs to face the Lions (Jordan Love, CJ Stroud, Mac Jones, Anthony Richardson) failed to reach 13 fantasy points against them

- HIT: Baker Mayfield, Geno Smith, Sam Darnold, Mason Rudolph

- MISS: Matthew Stafford, Kyler Murray, Dak Prescott, Jordan Love, CJ Stroud, Mac Jones, Anthony Richardson",,1,DET,WR,"🟡 Tim Patrick

- Would enter the WR 4/flex conversation if anything happened to Amon-Ra St. Brown or even Jameson Williams.

- He's locked in as the Lions' WR 3, playing 50% or more of the offensive snaps. Just something to know if you're thinking about playing the small Thanksgiving slate on DFS.

🔴 CHI VS WR:
- Suffocating WRs, holding them to the 4th fewest PPR points per game, including the 2nd fewest catches, 13th fewest yards, and 8th fewest TDs per game

- Just 9 WRs in 11 games have been able to reach even so much as 10 PPR points against the Bears.

- Just 6 WRs in 11 games have been able to reach 13 points against Chicago.

- HIT: Nico Collins, Gabe Davis, Terry McLaurin, Noah Brown, Christian Watson, Jordan Addison

- MISS: Calvin Ridley, Stefon Diggs, Tank Dell, Michael Pittman, Josh Downs, Diontae Johnson, Brian Thomas, Christian Kirk, Marvin Harrison, DeMario Douglas, Jayden Reed, Romeo Doubs, Justin Jefferson"
,1,Lions,,-9.5,28.5,,29,31,4,32,,7,HOU,WR,"🔵 Nico Collins

BOTTOM LINE: Nico Collins is arguably THE WR 1 in a mouthwatering week 13 matchup that he already shredded once this year.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Texans have a solid implied point total of 24 points, tied for the 11th most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. You want exposure to this offense.

- The Texans are 4.5 point road favorites, suggesting a neutral-positive game script and balanced offensive approach.

🔵 NICO COLLINS:
- Averaging an ELITE 22.2 PPR points per game over 5 full games where he played at least 44 offensive snaps, including 10.4 targets, 7.0 catches, 116.2 yards and 0.6 TDs (3 total)

- Scored 17 or more PPR points in 4 of 5 games, including 3 games over 20 with eruptions of 27.5 (week 2) and 33.1 (week 4 against these very same Jaguars).

🟢 CAREER VS THE JAGUARS:
- Caught 12(!) of 15(!) targets for 151(!) yards, 1 TD and 33.1(!) PPR points against these very same Jaguars in week 4.

- Entered the season averaging 14.4 PPR points and 6 targets per game after 2 games against the Jaguars with CJ Stroud as his QB.

- Scored 5.4 points on 3 targets in week 3 last year, followed by 23.4 points on 7 targets in week 12.

🔵 JAX VS WR:
- Hemorrhaging the 3rd most PPR points per game to enemy WRs, including the 5th most catches, 4th most yards, and 6th most TDs per game

- 11 WRs in 11 games have scored 15 or more PPR points against the Jaguars, including 6 that scored more than 21 with 2 different performances over 33

- HIT: Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, Khalil Shakir, Nico Collins, Stefon Diggs, Alec Pierce, Josh Downs, Keenan Allen, DeVonta Smith, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams

- MISS: Amari Cooper, DJ Moore, Jayden Reed, Romeo Doubs, Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison",,1,DET,RB,"🔵 Jahmyr Gibbs

BOTTOM LINE: Jahmyr Gibbs is a high upside RB 1 in this terrific game script and above-average matchup

🔵 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Lions have a mouthwatering implied point total of 29.5 points, the MOST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is THE offense you want exposure to in your week 12 lineups.

- The Lions are dominant 10.5 point home favorites, a wide spread that suggests a blowout win and supremely positive game script that *should* create a run-heavy approach as the Lions are trying to kill the clock in the 2nd half. It raises the potential rushing volume of Lions' ball carriers while potentially lessening the target potential for Lions' pass catchers.

🟢 JAHMYR GIBBS:
- Averaging 18.8 PPR points per game after 11 games, handling 16.4 touches per game—including 2.4 catches on 2.9 targets—for 104.6 scrimmage yards and 1.0 TDs (11 total)

- Scored 16 or more PPR points in 8 of 11 games (72.7%), including 3 games over 20 with a high of 32

- At absolute worst, he's landed between 12-15 PPR points in 3 of 11 games (27.3%)

🟢 CAREER VS CHICAGO:
- Averaging a sterling 19.35 PPR points off just 14 touches per game in 2 career games against the Bears.

- Scored 21.5 points on 14 touches in week 11 last year, followed by 17.2 points on 14 touches in week 14 a few weeks later.

🟡 CHI VS RB:
- Allowing the 12th most PPR points per game to enemy RBs, including the 15th most touches, 11th most scrimmage yards, and 15th most RB TDs.

- Vulnerable on the ground: Allowing the 8th most rushing yards and 8th most rushing TDs

- Stingey(ish) through the air: Allowing the 16th most catches but holding RBs to the 9th fewest receiving yards and NO receiving TDs.

- 7 RBs in 11 games have been able to reach 16 PPR points against the Bears, including 4 that went past 20.

- HIT: Tony Pollard, Jonathan Taylor, Kyren Williams, Chuba Hubbard, Cardinals RBs, Josh Jacobs, Aaron Jones

- MISS: Brian Robinson, Rhamondre Stevenson",,1,DET,QB,"🟡 Jared Goff

BOTTOM LINE: Jared Goff is a perfectly fine QB 2 and streamer with a nice implied point total but a tough matchup and a game script that may not ask him to throw much.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Lions have a mouthwatering implied point total of 29.5 points, the MOST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is THE offense you want exposure to in your week 12 lineups.

- The Lions are dominant 10.5 point home favorites, a wide spread that suggests a blowout win and supremely positive game script that *should* create a run-heavy approach as the Lions are trying to kill the clock in the 2nd half. It raises the potential rushing volume of Lions' ball carriers while potentially lessening the target potential for Lions' pass catchers.

🟡 JARED GOFF:
- Averaging 16.0 fantasy points per game after 11 games, including 27.8 passing attempts, 251 passing yards, 1.8 passing TDs (20 total), and 0.8 INTs (9 total)

- Scored 15 or more fantasy points in 5 of 11 games (45.5%), including just 2 games over 20 fantasy points (18.2%), though both went for 25.1 points (week 6) and 34.58 points (week 11)

- Scored fewer than 15 fantasy points in 4 of 6 games against Chicago, including BOTH tries last year.

- Otherwise scored 16.8 points in week 4 of 2021 and a high of 22.4 points in week 17 of 2022

🔴 CHI VS QB:
- Suffocating QBs, holding them to the 3rd fewest fantasy points per game (12.89), including the 13th fewest passing yards, 4th fewest passing TDs, 11th fewest rushing yards and 13th fewest rushing TDs

- Just 4 QBs in 11 games have been able to reach even just 12(!) fantasy points against the Bears

- Bleeding? Each of the last 2 QBs to face the Bears (Jordan Love and Sam Darnold) have scored more than 20 fantasy points against them

- HIT: Trevor Lawrence, Jayden Daniels, Jordan Love, Sam Darnold

- MISS: Will Levis, CJ Stroud, Anthony Richardson, Matthew Stafford, Andy Dalton, Kyler Murray, Drake Maye",,1,CHI,RB,"🟠 D'Andre Swift

BOTTOM LINE: D'Andre Swift is a boom or bust RB 2 who has a much clearer path to busting (giggity) than booming in a brutal week 13 matchup and game script against the team that drafted him. He'll likely need to rack up catches to stay afloat, which is hard to trust considering he's garnered 5 or more targets in just 3 of 11 games this year.

🔴 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Bears have a grossly low implied point total of just 19 points, tied for the 4th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Lions defense than one to heavily invest in with your week 13 lineups.

- The Bears are pathetic 10.5 point road underdogs, a dangerously wide spread that suggests a blowout loss and severely negative game script that will press the Bears into a(nother) pass-heavy approach if they fall behind. It puts rushing volume at risk for Bears' ball carriers while raising the target potential of Bears' pass catchers. Expect another 40+ passing attempts from Caleb Williams here.

🟡 D'ANDRE SWIFT:
- 16.4 PPR points on 16 touches in his first game with new Offensive Coordinator Thomas Brown, but 9.5 PPR points on 16 touches in his 2nd game under Brown.

- Now averaging 14.1 PPR points per game on the full 11 game, boom or bust season, handling 18.1 touches per game—including 2.8 catches on 3.3 targets—for 85.7 scrimmage yards and 0.5 TDs (5 total)

- Booms: Scored 14 or more PPR points in 6 of 11 games (54.5%), including 3 games over 20 with a high of 29.5

- Busts: Scored fewer than 10 PPR points in 5 of 11 games (45.5%), including a low of 3.

🔴 DET VS RB:
- Suffocating RBs, holding them to the 2nd fewest PPR points per game, including the FEWEST touches, 2nd fewest scrimmage yards and 7th fewest TDs from scrimmage

- Tough on the ground: Holding RBs to the 4th fewest rushing yards and 14th fewest rushing TDs

- Impossible through the air: Holding RBs to the 3rd fewest catches, 5th fewest receiving yard and NO receiving TDs.

- Just 3 RBs in 11 games have been able to reach 15 PPR points against the Lions despite 7 of them handling 15 or more touches

,,,,,,,,,,,,14,PHI,WR,"🔵 AJ Brown

BOTTOM LINE: AJ Brown is an exciting, high end WR 1 play with shootout and matchup based upside in week 13

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- Eagles at Ravens has a mouthwatering over/under of 51.5 points, easily the HIGHEST among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. Both teams are sporting top 11 implied point totals above 24 points, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points. If I had to build a fantasy football lineup out of ONE game this week, Eagles at Ravens would THE game. You want exposure to this game.

- The Eagles have a solid implied point total of 24.25 points, the 11th most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. You want exposure to this offense.

- The Eagles are 3 point road underdogs, suggesting mostly neutral game script and a balanced offensive approach that *could* turn pass heavy if the Eagles fall behind early.

🟢 AJ BROWN:
- Averaging 17.0 PPR points per game after 8 games, including 7.0 targets, 4.9 catches, 90.9 yards and 0.5 TDs (4 total)

- Scored fewer than 14 PPR points in the other 3 games, including a low of 5.6 in week 9.

🔵 BAL VS WR:
- Hemorrhaging the MOST PPR points per game to WRs, including the 3rd most catches, 3rd most yards, and 3rd most TDs per game.

- 11 WRs in 12 games have scored 16 or more PPR points against the Ravens, 7 of which scored 20 or more

- 5 WRs in the last 10 games have scored at least 26 PPR points against the Ravens, 4 of which have been within the last 8 games

- HIT: Rashee Rice (RIP), Xavier Worthy, Davante Adams, Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, Terry McLaurin, Cedric Tillman, Elijah Moore, Courtland Sutton, Ja'Marr Chase, George Pickens

- MISS: CeeDee Lamb",,1,DET,WR,"🟡 Amon-Ra St. Brown

BOTTOM LINE: Amon-Ra St. Brown is a high end WR 1 any time he's on a football field, but there IS some added risk in week 13 thanks to a knee injury and brutal matchup that he's struggled a bit with in the past.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Lions have a mouthwatering implied point total of 29.5 points, the MOST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is THE offense you want exposure to in your week 12 lineups.

- The Lions are dominant 10.5 point home favorites, a wide spread that suggests a blowout win and supremely positive game script that *should* create a run-heavy approach as the Lions are trying to kill the clock in the 2nd half. It raises the potential rushing volume of Lions' ball carriers while potentially lessening the target potential for Lions' pass catchers.

🟢 AMON-RA ST. BROWN:
- Dealing with a new knee injury that kept him out of Monday's practice. Something to keep an eye on.

- Averaging 18.1 PPR points per game after 11 games, including 7.8 targets, 6.5 catches, 67.5 yards and 0.8 TDs (9 total)

- Scored 16 or more PPR points in 7 of 11 games (63.6%), including 4 games over 20 (36.4%) with a high of 38.7(!)

- Landed between 12-14 PPR points in 2 of 11 games (18.2%), mixing in 2 games under 9 PPR points with a low of 4.3 way back in week 1.

🟡 CAREER VS CHICAGO:
- Averaging 13.07 PPR points and 8 targets per game after 6 career boom or bust games against the Bears since entering the league in 2021.

- Scored fewer than 11 PPR points in 3 of 6 games against the Bears, including duds of 6.3 (week 12 of 2021) and 5.1 (week 14 last year)

- Scored 21.7 in week 11 last year and 22.1 in week 10 of 2022.

🔴 CHI VS WR:
- Suffocating WRs, holding them to the 4th fewest PPR points per game, including the 2nd fewest catches, 13th fewest yards, and 8th fewest TDs per game

- Just 9 WRs in 11 games have been able to reach even so much as 10 PPR points against the Bears.

- Just 6 WRs in 11 games have been able to reach 13 points against Chicago.

BOTTOM LINE: Jameson Williams is a boom or bust WR 3 who's a real week 13 coin flip with a high projected point total but a brutal week 13 matchup.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Lions have a mouthwatering implied point total of 29.5 points, the MOST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is THE offense you want exposure to in your week 12 lineups.

- The Lions are dominant 10.5 point home favorites, a wide spread that suggests a blowout win and supremely positive game script that *should* create a run-heavy approach as the Lions are trying to kill the clock in the 2nd half. It raises the potential rushing volume of Lions' ball carriers while potentially lessening the target potential for Lions' pass catchers.

🟡 JAMESON WILLIAMS:
- Averaging 13 PPR points per game after 9 boom or bust games, including 5.3 targets, 3.2 catches, 71.1 yards and 0.4 TDs (4 total)

- Booms: Scored 14 or more PPR points in 5 of 9 games (55.6%), including 2 games over 18 with highs of 22.6 (week 11) and 24.4 (week 1)

- Busts: Scored fewer than 12 PPR points in 4 of 9 games (44.4%), including 3 games under 9 with 2 duds of 1.2 (week 3) and 0.6 (week 7)

🔴 CHI VS WR:
- Suffocating WRs, holding them to the 4th fewest PPR points per game, including the 2nd fewest catches, 13th fewest yards, and 8th fewest TDs per game

- Just 9 WRs in 11 games have been able to reach even so much as 10 PPR points against the Bears.

- Just 6 WRs in 11 games have been able to reach 13 points against Chicago.

- HIT: Nico Collins, Gabe Davis, Terry McLaurin, Noah Brown, Christian Watson, Jordan Addison

- MISS: Calvin Ridley, Stefon Diggs, Tank Dell, Michael Pittman, Josh Downs, Diontae Johnson, Brian Thomas, Christian Kirk, Marvin Harrison, DeMario Douglas, Jayden Reed, Romeo Doubs, Justin Jefferson",,1,CHI,RB,"🔴 Roschon Johnson

BOTTOM LINE: Roschon Johnson is NOT a recommended RB 3/flex play in this brutal matchup and even worse game script.

🔴 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Bears have a grossly low implied point total of just 19 points, tied for the 4th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Lions defense than one to heavily invest in with your week 13 lineups.

- The Bears are pathetic 10.5 point road underdogs, a dangerously wide spread that suggests a blowout loss and severely negative game script that will press the Bears into a(nother) pass-heavy approach if they fall behind. It puts rushing volume at risk for Bears' ball carriers while raising the target potential of Bears' pass catchers. Expect another 40+ passing attempts from Caleb Williams here.

🔴 ROSCHON JOHNSON:
- Scored 11.1 PPR points (1 touchdown) on 11 touches in his first game under new Offensive Coordinator Thomas Brown and then found the end zone again (8.2 PPR points) in his 2nd game under Brown, but on just 3 touches. 

- He's a touchdown or bust, last resort RB 3/flex play moving forward.

🔴 DET VS RB:
- Suffocating RBs, holding them to the 2nd fewest PPR points per game, including the FEWEST touches, 2nd fewest scrimmage yards and 7th fewest TDs from scrimmage

- Tough on the ground: Holding RBs to the 4th fewest rushing yards and 14th fewest rushing TDs

- Impossible through the air: Holding RBs to the 3rd fewest catches, 5th fewest receiving yard and NO receiving TDs.

- Just 3 RBs in 11 games have been able to reach 15 PPR points against the Lions despite 7 of them handling 15 or more touches

- Games played: 11
- RBs who handled 10 or more touches: 11
- RBs who scored 10 or more PPR points: 8
- RBs who handled 15 or more touches: 7

,2,Giants,37.5,3.5,17,,9,6,23,31,,,,,,,2,NYG,WR,"🟢 Malik Nabers

BOTTOM LINE: Malik Nabers is a volume-based WR 2 with always-present WR 1 upside, especially in not-scary matchups like this.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- Giants at Cowboys has a nauseating over/under of just 37.5 points, easily the LOWEST among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting bottom 11 implied totals under 21 points, suggesting a yawnfest that won't feature many fantasy points. This is a game to mostly avoid in week 13.

- The Giants have a nauseatingly low implied point total of just 17 points, the 2nd fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Cowboys defense than one to heavily invest in with your week 13 lineups.

- The Giants are 3 point road underdogs, suggesting a neutral-negative game script that *could* turn pass heavy if the Giants fall behind early in week 13.

🟢 MALIK NABERS:
- Caught 6 of 9 nice targets for 64 scoreless yards (12.4 PPR points) in his first game with Tommy DeVito.

- Shortly after the game, Nabers threw a tempter tantrum—complete with obnoxious gum-chomping that had Pete Carroll pitching a tent—in public that reminded me of my daughter's 3 year old days, potentially leading to ""squeaky wheel"" treatment in week 13. Look for the Giants to prioritize getting him the ball right away (as they should)

- Now averaging 16.9 PPR points per game over 9 games, including 11.4 targets, 7.4 catches, 74.3 yards and 0.3 TDs (3 total)

- Landed between 10-15 PPR points in 5 of 9 games (55.6%), mixing in a season low of 8.1 points (week 7) and 3 games over 23 (33.3%)

🟢 Caught 12(!) of 15(!) targets for 111 scoreless yards (23.1 PPR points) in week 4 against these Cowboys, albeit with Daniel Jones at QB.

🟡 DAL VS WR: Mediocre across the board
- Allowing the 11th most PPR points per game to enemy WRs, including the 13th most catches, 12th most yards and 16th most TDs

- 7 WRs in 11 games have scored 15 or more PPR points against the Cowboys, including 3 that scored more than 20

- HIT: Rashid Shaheed, Malik Nabers, Wan'Dale Robinson, Jameson Williams, Darnell Mooney, AJ Brown, Terry McLaurin

- MISS: Amari Cooper (Browns), Zay Flowers, George Pickens, Deebo Samuel, DeVonta Smith, Nico Collins, Tank Dell",,1,DET,TE,"🟡 Sam LaPorta

BOTTOM LINE: Sam LaPorta is a touchdown or bust TE 1 with a nice implied point total and a not-so-scary matchup.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Lions have a mouthwatering implied point total of 29.5 points, the MOST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is THE offense you want exposure to in your week 12 lineups.

- The Lions are dominant 10.5 point home favorites, a wide spread that suggests a blowout win and supremely positive game script that *should* create a run-heavy approach as the Lions are trying to kill the clock in the 2nd half. It raises the potential rushing volume of Lions' ball carriers while potentially lessening the target potential for Lions' pass catchers.

🟡 SAM LAPORTA:
- Averaging 8.5 PPR points per game after 10 games, including 3.8 targets, 2.8 catches, 38.5 yards and 0.3 TDs (3 total)

- Scored 12-17 PPR points in 3 of 10 games (30%), EACH of which have been within the last 6 games.

- Scored fewer than 10 PPR points in 7 of 10 games (70%), including 4 games under 5 points.

- 6 targets in 3 of the last 4 games, averaging 5.25 targets per game over the last month.

- Alternating big days with duds, scoring 12.2 points in week 6, but then 3.5 points in week 7, but then 16.8 points in week 8, but then 4.8 points in week 9, but then 15.6 points in week 10, but then 4.9 points in week 12.

🟠 CAREER VS CHICAGO:
- Averaging just 4.55 PPR points on 5.5 targets per game after 2 games against the Bears.

- Scored 4.8 points on 5 targets in week 11 last year, followed by 4.3 points on 6 targets just a few weeks later in week 14.

🟡 CHI VS TE:
- Holding TEs to the 12th fewest PPR points per game, including the 12th fewest catches and FEWEST TDs

- That said, they ARE allowing the 10th most TE yards so...that's cool.

- 3 TEs in the last 6 games scored 14 or more PPR points against the Bears. But they're also the ONLY 3 in 11 games to reach 10 PPR points against Chicago.

- HIT: Evan Engram, Zach Ertz, TJ Hockenson

- MISS: Trey McBride, Hunter Henry, Tucker Kraft",,1,CHI,WR,"🟡 Keenan Allen

BOTTOM LINE: Keenan Allen is a boom or bust, higher end WR 4/flex with some matchup and game script (pass heavy) based appeal in week 13.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Bears have a grossly low implied point total of just 19 points, tied for the 4th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Lions defense than one to heavily invest in with your week 13 lineups.

It puts rushing volume at risk for Bears' ball carriers while raising the target potential of Bears' pass catchers. Expect another 40+ passing attempts from Caleb Williams here.

🟡 KEENAN ALLEN:
- 23 targets, 13 catches, 127 yards and 1 TD in 2 games under new Offensive Coordinator Thomas Brown.

- Scored just 8.1 PPR points on 8 targets in week 11, but then 23.6(!) points on 15(!) targets in week 12.

- Now averaging 11.7 PPR points per game over his last 7 boom or bust games in a Bears jersey, including 8.1 targets, 4.6 catches, 45.7 yards and 0.4 TDs (3 total)

- Booms: Scored 21+ PPR points in 2 of the last 6 games

- Busts: Scored fewer than 10 PPR points in 5 of the last 7 games

🔵 DET VS WR:
- Hemorrhaging the 4th most PPR points per game to WRs, including the MOST catches and 2nd most yards per game

- Yet somehow holding WRs to the 4th fewest TDs.

- Allowing 15.27(!) catches and 187.18(!) yards per game yet somehow holding WRs to just 0.55 TDs per game, the Lions defense is bound to be on the wrong end of touchdown regression sooner or later.

- 10 WRs in 11 games have scored 15 or more PPR points against the Lions, including 4 that scored 21 or more.

- HIT: Cooper Kupp, Chris Godwin, Marvin Harrison, DK Metcalf, CeeDee Lamb, Justin Jefferson, Calvin Ridley, Jayden Reed, John Metchie, Michael Pittman

- MISS: Mike Evans, Jordan Addison, Romeo Doubs, Tank Dell, Brian Thomas",,2,DAL,WR,"🟠 Brandin Cooks

- *Could* return from a knee injury in week 13, though it's unclear what kind of role he'd play.

- It might not matter, as Cooks was averaging fewr than 7 PPR points and 5 targets per game even with Dak Prescott under center."
,2,Cowboys,,-3.5,20.5,,4,4,11,18,,,,,,,2,DAL,WR,"🟡 CeeDee Lamb

BOTTOM LINE: CeeDee Lamb remains a talent-based, high end WR 2 in this difficult matchup, one that he's had no trouble with in the past.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- Giants at Cowboys has a nauseating over/under of just 37.5 points, easily the LOWEST among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting bottom 11 implied totals under 21 points, suggesting a yawnfest that won't feature many fantasy points. This is a game to mostly avoid in week 13.

- The Cowboys have a low point total of just 20.5 points, the 11th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. Theoretically, they're more of an offense to target with the Giants' defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

- The Cowboys are 3.5 point home favorites, suggesting a neutral-positive game script and balanced offensive approach.

🟡 CEEDEE LAMB:
- Averaging 14.6 PPR points per game after 3 full games with Cooper Rush, including 11.3 targets, 8.0 catches and 66.0 scoreless scrimmage yards per game

- Scored 8.4 PPR points on 10 targets in week 10, but followed that up with 18.6 points on 12 targets in week 11 and 16.8 points on 12 targets in week 12.

🟢 Caught 8 of 12 targets for 87 yards and 1 TD (22.7 PPR points) with Cooper Rush as his QB against the Giants back in week 3 of 2022 (lol)

- Caught 7 of 8 targets for 106 yards and 1 TD (23.6 PPR points) against these Giants back in week 4, albeit with Dak Prescott at QB.

🟠 NYG VS WR:
- Holding WRs to the 10th fewest PPR points per game, including the 11th fewest catches and 12th fewest yards.

- That said, they ARE allowing the 16th ""most"" TDs so...watch out, world.

- HIT: Justin Jefferson, Amari Cooper (Browns), CeeDee Lamb, AJ Brown, Terry McLaurin

- MISS: Terry McLaurin, DK Metcalf, Ja'Marr Chase, DeVonta Smith, George Pickens, Mike Evans",,2,NYG,RB,"🟢 Tyrone Tracy

BOTTOM LINE: Being road underdogs is far from ideal for a running back, but Tyrone Tracy is a high end RB 3/flex with cautiously optimistic upside based on this mouthwatering matchup and a sliver of positive TD regression optimism

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- Giants at Cowboys has a nauseating over/under of just 37.5 points, easily the LOWEST among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate.

🔵 DAL VS RB:
- Hemorrhaging the 4th most PPR points per game to RBs, including the 13th most touches, 8th most scrimmage yards and 3rd most TDs from scrimmage.

- Great matchup on the ground: Allowing the 10th most rushing yards and 2nd most rushing TDs per game

BOTTOM LINE: Tua Tagovailoa is a perfectly fine QB 1/2/streamer in this possibly high scoring game but subpar matchup.

🟡 GAME SCRIPT:
- Dolphins at Packers has a strong over/under of 47.5 points, tied for the 4th highest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. Both teams are sporting top 18 implied point totals of 22 or more, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points if the Dolphins can exceed expectations.

- The Dolphins have a mediocre implied point total of 22 points, tied for the 14th ""fewest"" among all 32 teams on the week 13 slate.

BOTTOM LINE: Rico Dowdle is a high end RB 3/flex with cautiously optimistic upside for a lot more in a great week 13 matchup.

BOTTOM LINE: Jaylen Waddle is a cautiously optimistic, boom or bust WR 3 who's still worth playing in this potentially high scoring game but tough(ish) matchup.

🟡 GAME SCRIPT:
- Dolphins at Packers has a strong over/under of 47.5 points, tied for the 4th highest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. Both teams are sporting top 18 implied point totals of 22 or more, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points if the Dolphins can exceed expectations.

- The Dolphins have a mediocre implied point total of 22 points, tied for the 14th ""fewest"" among all 32 teams on the week 13 slate.

- The Dolphins are 3.5 point road underdogs, suggesting neutral-negative game script and a balanced offensive approach that *could* turn pass heavy if the Dolphins fall behind early.

🟡 JAYLEN WADDLE:
- (Finally) exploded for 8 catches (9 targets), 144 yards and 1 TD (28.4 PPR points) in week 12, providing hope that he's ready to start a hot streak.

- Now averaging 12.5 PPR points per game over 6 full games with Tua Tagovailoa, including 5.2 targets, 4.0 catches, 65.0 yards and 0.3 TDs (2 total)

- Scored 16.2 PPR points in week 1 and 28.4 PPR points last week.

- Sandwiched 4 straight games under 9 PPR points into the middle of that.

- Averaging 11.8 PPR points and 5.2 targets per game in 5 games since Tua returned.

BOTTOM LINE: Drew Lock would actually be a solid desperation QB 2 in week 13. He's just better than Tommy DeVito, at least for fantasy.

🔴 GAME SCRIPT:
- Giants at Cowboys has a nauseating over/under of just 37.5 points, easily the LOWEST among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting bottom 11 implied totals under 21 points, suggesting a yawnfest that won't feature many fantasy points. This is a game to mostly avoid in week 13.

- The Giants have a nauseatingly low implied point total of just 17 points, the 2nd fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Cowboys defense than one to heavily invest in with your week 13 lineups.

- The Giants are 3 point road underdogs, suggesting a neutral-negative game script that *could* turn pass heavy if the Giants fall behind early in week 13.

- 8 QBs in 11 games have scored 15 or more fantasy points against the Cowboys, including 6 that scored more than 21

- THAT SAID, if you remove QB rushing statistics, then just 4 QBs in 11 games have been able to reach 15 fantasy points against Dallas

- Still, 6 of the last 7 QBs to face the Cowboys scored at least 15 fantasy points against them, 4 of which(!) scored more than 25

- 6 targets in EACH of the last 3 games

🟡 DAL VS TE:

BOTTOM LINE: Jordan Love is a solid back end QB 1 play in this potentially high scoring game, but be warned that this IS a difficult matchup.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- Dolphins at Packers has a strong over/under of 47.5 points, tied for the 4th highest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. Both teams are sporting top 18 implied point totals of 22 or more, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points if the Dolphins can exceed expectations.

- Just 3 QBs in 11 games have been able to reach even just 14 fantasy points against the Dolphins

- THAT SAID, EACH of those 3 scored 17 or more fantasy points—including 2 games over 20 with a high of 22.18—and EACH of those 3 have been within the last 5games. The Dolphins are bleeding a little bit

- MISS: Trevor Lawrence, Josh Allen, Geno Smith, Mason Rudolph, Jacoby Brissett, Anthony Richardson, Matthew Stafford, Drake Maye",,4,KC,RB,"🟢⚠️ Isiah Pacheco

BOTTOM LINE: Isiah Pacheco is a high risk, high reward RB 3/flex with some matchup and game script based upside in his first game back from a 2 month injury.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Chiefs have a strong implied point total of 27.5 points, the 2nd most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is an offense you want exposure to in your week 13 lineups.

- The Chiefs are dominant 12.5 point home favorites, a wide spread that suggests a blowout win and supremely positive game script that *should* create a run-heavy approach as the Chiefs are trying to kill the clock in the 2nd half. It raises the potential rushing volume of Chiefs' ball carriers while potentially lessening the target potential for Chiefs' pass catchers.

🟡⚠️ ISIAH PACHECO:
- Potentially set to return from an ankle injury that's kept him out of the last 8 games. That said, Dr. Deepak Chona calls him a ""high risk start"" and warns of disappointing return results: ""Data projects major stats dip and workload limits. Average ramp up takes 4-6 weeks.""

- WAS off to a great start, scoring 15-16 PPR points in EACH of the first 2 games on 41 total touches. But, again, unless otherwise reported, we shouldn't expect anything close to that in his first (or perhaps even second...or third...or fourth...) game back, especially with Kareem Hunt playing well; there's no reason to rush Pacheco and throw him back into the fire.

🟢 CAREER VS THE RAIDERS:
- Averaging 16.97 PPR points and 14.3 touches per game over 3 career games vs the Raiders where he handled at least 8 touches.

- Scored 12 or more PPR points in all 3 games, including an eruption of 25.9 points on 20 touches in week 12 last year.

🟢 LV VS RB:
- Allowing the 13th most PPR points per game to enemy RBs, including the 11th most touches, 17th most scrimmage yards and 10th most RB TDs

- Mediocre matchup on the ground: Allowing the 14th most rushing yards and 15th most rushing TDs

- Slightly friendlier through the air: Allowing the 10th most catches and 6th most receiving TDs despite holding RBs to the 12th fewest receiving yards.

BOTH teams are sporting bottom 11 implied totals under 21 points, suggesting a yawnfest that won't feature many fantasy points. This is a game to mostly avoid in week 13.

- The Cowboys have a low point total of just 20.5 points, the 11th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. Theoretically, they're more of an offense to target with the Giants' defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

- The Cowboys are 3.5 point home favorites, suggesting a neutral-positive game script and balanced offensive approach.

🟠 COOPER RUSH:
- Averaging 11.3 fantasy points per game over the last 4 games, including 33.8 passing attempts, 190.3 passing yards, 1.0 passing TDs (4 total) and 0.3 INTs (1 total)

- Scored 9 points in week 9 and 2 points in week 10, but followed those up with 16.36 points in week 11 and 17.98 points in week 12.

- In 5 previous career NFL games where Cooper Rush threw at least 27 passes, he's averaging 13.2 fantasy points per game, including 235.8 passing yards, 1.4 passing TDs (7 total) and 0.8 INTs (4 total) per game

- He scored 17 fantasy points in 2 of those 5 games, but otherwise scored fewer than 14 points in each of the other 3 games, including a low of 5.2

🟠 In 1 full career game against the Giants back in week 3 of 2022, Cooper Rush completed 21 of 31 passes for 215 yards and 1 TD (12.4 fantasy points)

🟡 NYG VS QB:
- Technically allowing the 9th most fantasy points per game (17.9) to QBs, but it's somewhat misleading...

- For starters, the Giants don't intercept the ball. They're averaging just 0.09 interceptions per game, tied for the FEWEST in all of football.

- Second, they're hemorrhaging production to rushing QBs, allowing the 4th most rushing yards and 3rd most rushing TDs per game

- But they're tough through the air, holding QBs to the 7th fewest passing yards and 10th fewest passing TDs.

- Still, 8 QBs in the last 9 games have scored 15 or more fantasy points against the Giants, including 3 that scored more than 20.

- Even if you remove their rushing statistics, 5 QBs in the last 9 games scored 15 or more fantasy points against the G Men.

🟡 MIA VS RB:
- Allowing the 16th most PPR points per game to RBs, including the 6th most RB TDs

- That said, despite the TD allowance, Miami is actually holding RBs to the 8th fewest touches and 11th fewest scrimmage yards

- Mediocre(ish) on the ground: Holding RBs to the 13th fewest rushing yards but allowing the 8th most rushing TDs per game

- Mediocre(ish) through the air: Holding RBs to the 11th fewest catches and 11th fewest receiving yards, but allowing the 6th most receiving TDs.

BOTTOM LINE: The pending return of Isiah Pacheco adds plenty of risk to Kareem Hunt as a fantasy football start. But in Pacheco's first game back in 2 months, Hunt remains a high end RB 3/flex with strong upside in this delicious game script and solid matchup.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:

- Isiah Pacheco is otentially set to return from an ankle injury that's kept him out of the last 9 games. That said, Dr. Deepak Chona calls him a ""high risk start"" and warns of disappointing return results: ""Data projects major stats dip and workload limits. Average ramp up takes 4-6 weeks."" Kareem Hunt isn't likely to just disappear, especially in Pacheco's first game back in 2 months.

- Hunt is averaging 14.8 PPR points per game over 8 games as the Chiefs RB 1.

- He WAS handling 21.5(!) touches per game—including 2.1 catches on 2.8 targets—for 89.0 scrimmage yards and 0.6 TDs (5 total)

- He scored 17 or more PPR points in 4 of 8 games (50%), including a high of 22.3 back in week 7.

- He scored 10-13 PPR points in 3 of 8 games, mixing in a low of 6 points in week 11.

🟠 Scored just 13.3 PPR points despite 22 touches against the Raiders in week 8 (63 scrimmage yards and 1 TD)

🟢 LV VS RB:
- Allowing the 13th most PPR points per game to enemy RBs, including the 11th most touches, 17th most scrimmage yards and 10th most RB TDs

- Mediocre matchup on the ground: Allowing the 14th most rushing yards and 15th most rushing TDs

- Slightly friendlier through the air: Allowing the 10th most catches and 6th most receiving TDs despite holding RBs to the 12th fewest receiving yards.

- 9 RBs in 11  games scored 15 or more PPR points against the Raiders, including 5 that scored more than 20.

- Games played: 11
- RBs who handled 10 or more touches: 12
- RBs who scored 10 or more PPR points: 12

- MISS: Gus Edwards, Kareem Hunt, Javonte Williams",,2,DAL,WR,"🔴 Jalen Tolbert 

BOTTOM LINE: Jalen Tolbert is NOT a recommended WR 4/flex play in week 13.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- Giants at Cowboys has a nauseating over/under of just 37.5 points, easily the LOWEST among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting bottom 11 implied totals under 21 points, suggesting a yawnfest that won't feature many fantasy points. This is a game to mostly avoid in week 13.

- The Cowboys have a low point total of just 20.5 points, the 11th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. Theoretically, they're more of an offense to target with the Giants' defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

- The Cowboys are 3.5 point home favorites, suggesting a neutral-positive game script and balanced offensive approach.

🟠 JALEN TOLBERT:
- Averaging 6.2 PPR points per game after 3 full games with Cooper Rush, including 4.7 targets, 2.3 catches, 19.0 yards and 0.3 TDs (1 total

- Scored fewer than 5 PPR points on 5 targets in EACH of the first 2 full games with Rush before scoring 10.2 PPR points (thanks to 1 TD) on 4 targets in week 12.

- Brandin Cooks may be activated at any moment.

🟠 NYG VS WR:
- Holding WRs to the 10th fewest PPR points per game, including the 11th fewest catches and 12th fewest yards.

- That said, they ARE allowing the 16th ""most"" TDs so...watch out, world.

- Just 5 WRs in 11 games have been able to reach 15 PPR points against the Giants, only 2 of which have been within the last 7 games

- HIT: Justin Jefferson, Amari Cooper (Browns), CeeDee Lamb, AJ Brown, Terry McLaurin

- MISS: Terry McLaurin, DK Metcalf, Ja'Marr Chase, DeVonta Smith, George Pickens, Mike Evans",,5,ATL,RB,"🔵 Tyler Allgeier

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,LV,WR,"🟢 Jakobi Meyers

BOTTOM LINE: Jakobi Meyers is a high end WR 3 with volume-based WR 2 upside in a bleeding, not-scary matchup. Meyers could be a garbage time hero in week 13.

🟡 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Raiders have a dangerously low implied point total of just 15 points, easily the FEWEST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're an offense to attack with the Chiefs defense, not an offense to put in your lineups.

- The Raiders are pathetic 12.5 point road underdogs, a dangerously wide spread that suggests a blowout loss and supremely negative game script that will force the Raiders into a pass-heavy approach if they fall behind. It puts rushing volume at risk for Raiders' ball carriers while raising the target potential of Raiders' pass catchers.

🟢 JAKOBI MEYERS:
- Averaging 15.6 PPR points per game over the last 7 games since week 3, which also just so happens to be Davante Adams' last appearance in a Raiders' uniform.

- Averaging 9.6 targets, 6.6 catches, 72.7 yards and 0.3 TDs (2 total) per game over the last 7, albeit mostly with Gardner Minshew.

- Scored 13 or more PPR points in 5 of the last 7 games, including 3 games over 17 with a high of 22.1 just last week.

- Scored fewer than 10 PPR points in 2 of the last 6 games.

- Jakobi Meyers will now be the WR 1 in an Aidan O'Connell offense. In 10 games in that role last year, Davante Adams averaged 16.2 PPR points and 11(!) targets per game.

- Obviously Meyers will still vie with Brock Bowers for top targets, but it's just those 2 guys and a massive gap after it.

- And by the way, Meyers himself averaged a still-solid 11.1 PPR points and 5.3 targets per game despite playing second fiddle to Adams in O'Connell's offense last year.

- With 55 touches and 602 yards but just 2 TDs this season, Jakobi Meyers is starting to appear on the Positive TD Regression tab (see tab below)

🟢 CAREER VS KANSAS CITY:
- Caught 6 of 7 targets for 52 yards and 1 TD (17.2 PPR points) against these very same Chiefs in week 8.

- Averaged 13.65 PPR points and 6 targets per game in 2 games against the Chiefs with Aidan O'Connell at QB last year.

- Scored 20.1 PPR points on 7 targets (6 catches, 79 yards, 1 TD) in week 12

- Scored 7.2 PPR points on 5 targets (3 catches, 42 yards) in week 16

🟡 KC VS WR:
- Holding WRs to the 15th fewest PPR points per game, including the 15th fewest catches and 6th fewest yards.

- That said, they ARE allowing the 11th most TDs

- 8 WRs in 11 games were able to score 15 or more PPR points against the Chiefs, only one of which was able to reach 20 (David Moore, of all people)

- 4 WRs in the last 3 games have scored 15 or more PPR points against the Chiefs

- HIT: Drake London, Ladd McConkey, Rashid Shaheed, Jakobi Meyers, Courtland Sutton, Curtis Samuel, Khalil Shakir, David Moore

- MISS: Zay Flowers, Ja'Marr Chase, Chris Olave, Amari Cooper",,4,KC,WR,"🟡 DeAndre Hopkins

BOTTOM LINE: DeAndre Hopkins is a high end WR 4 with a sexy implied point total but a difficult matchup and limited playing time.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Chiefs have a strong implied point total of 27.5 points, the 2nd most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is an offense you want exposure to in your week 13 lineups.

- The Chiefs are dominant 12.5 point home favorites, a wide spread that suggests a blowout win and supremely positive game script that *should* create a run-heavy approach as the Chiefs are trying to kill the clock in the 2nd half. It raises the potential rushing volume of Chiefs' ball carriers while potentially lessening the target potential for Chiefs' pass catchers.

🟡 DEANDRE HOPKINS:
- Averaging 12.7 PPR points per game after 5 games in a Chiefs' uniform, including 5.4 targets, 4.4 catches, 47.0 yards and 0.6 TDs (3 total)

- Scored 28.6 PPR points in week 9 and 14.5 PPR points in week 12.

- Scored fewer than 10 PPR points in the other 3 games.

🟠 LV VS WR:
- Holding WRs to the 12th fewest PPR points per game, including the 15th fewest catches, 8th fewest yards, and 17th fewest TDs

- Just 11 WRs in 11 games have been able to reach even just 10 PPR points against the Raiders, only 4 of which were able to reach 15.

- Just 2 WR in the last 8 games has been able to reach 15 PPR points against the Raiders

- HIT: Zay Flowers, Diontae Johnson, Ladd McConkey, Tyreek Hill, Courtland Sutton

- MISS: Amari Cooper, Courtland Sutton, George Pickens, Ja'Marr Chase, Jaylen Waddle",,2,DAL,TE,"🟡 Luke Schoonmaker

BOTTOM LINE: Luke Schoonmaker is a perfectly fine fill-in TE 2, but he's lower on the list of streaming options in this difficult matchup and low-scoring game.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- Giants at Cowboys has a nauseating over/under of just 37.5 points, easily the LOWEST among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting bottom 11 implied totals under 21 points, suggesting a yawnfest that won't feature many fantasy points. This is a game to mostly avoid in week 13.

- The Cowboys are 3.5 point home favorites, suggesting a neutral-positive game script and balanced offensive approach.

🟡 LUKE SCHOONMAKER:
- Averaging a sterling 12.1 PPR points over 3 games where Jake Ferguson played fewer than 8 offensive snaps (or not at all), including 6.7 targets, 5.0 catches, 51.3 yards and 0.3 TDs (1 total)

- Scored 10.3 PPR points on 6 targets in week 2 (albeit with Dak Prescott at QB)

- Scored 11.6 PPR points on 10 targets in week 11 (Cooper Rush)

- Scored 14.5 PPR points on 4 targets in week 12 (Rush)

🔴 NYG VS TE:
- Theoretically suffocating TEs, holding them to the 2nd fewest PPR points per game, including the 3rd fewest catches, 4th fewest yards and FEWEST TDs

- Just 2 TEs in 11 games have been able to reach even just 9 PPR points against the Giants

- That said, the Giants also haven't faced many fantasy-relevant TEs.

- HIT: Zach Ertz, Jake Ferguson

- MISS: Noah Fant, Pat Freiermuth, Zach Ertz, Ja'Tavion Sanders, Cade Otton",,6,NEP,RB,"🟡 Antonio Gibson

- Would enter the RB 3/flex conversation if anything happened to Rhamondre Stevenson.

- Played 1 more snap and handled just 1 less touch than Rhamondre Stevenson in week 12. Keep an eye on it."
,5,Chargers,47.5,-1.5,24.5,,19,27,19,23,,,,,,,4,LV,TE,"🟢 Brock Bowers

BOTTOM LINE: Brock Bowers is a high end TE 1 with double digit target potential in week 13.

🟡 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Raiders have a dangerously low implied point total of just 15 points, easily the FEWEST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're an offense to attack with the Chiefs defense, not an offense to put in your lineups.

- The Raiders are pathetic 12.5 point road underdogs, a dangerously wide spread that suggests a blowout loss and supremely negative game script that will force the Raiders into a pass-heavy approach if they fall behind. It puts rushing volume at risk for Raiders' ball carriers while raising the target potential of Raiders' pass catchers.

🟢 BROCK BOWERS:
- Averaging 16.1 PPR points per game over the last 8 games since Davante Adams last appeared in a Raiders' uniform, including 9.8 targets, 7.0 catches, 68.4 yards and 0.4 TDs (3 total)

- Scored 15 or more PPR points in 5 of the last 8 games (62.5%), including 2 games over 23 with a high of 31.6

- Will now be catching passes from Aidan O'Connell. Bowers caught 9 of 10 O'Connell targets in week 6 for 71 scoreless yards and 16.1 PPR points.

- With 74 catches and 744 yards but just 3 TDs, Bowers is getting pretty high up the Positive TD Regression tab (see tab below)

🟡 Caught 5 of 5 targets for 58 scoreless yards and 10.8 PPR points against these very same Chiefs in week 8.

🔵 KC VS TE:
- Hemorrhaging the 2nd most PPR points per game to enemy TEs, including the MOST catches, MOST yards, and 12th most TDs per game

- 5 TEs in 11 games have scored at least 10 PPR points against the Chiefs

- 4 TEs in 11 games have scored 15 or more PPR points against the Chiefs

- HIT: Isaiah Likely, Mike Gesicki, George Kittle, Brock Bowers, Cade Otton

- MISS: Mark Andrews, Kyle Pitts",,5,LAC,RB,"🟡 Gus Edwards

BOTTOM LINE: If JK Dobbins is out, Gus Edwards is a volume-based RB 3/flex, but this is a tough matchup for him.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- Chargers at Falcons has a solid over/under of 47.5 points, tied for the 4th highest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting top 16 implied totals of 23 or more points, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points. If I had to build a fantasy football lineup out of ONE game this week, Chargers at Falcons would be at or near the top of the list. You WANT exposure to this game.

- The Chargers have a solid implied point total of 24.5 points, tied for the 9th most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. You want exposure to this offense.

- The Chargers are narrow 1.5 point road favorites, suggesting a close game, neutral game script and a balanced offensive approach.

🟡 GUS EDWARDS:
- JK Dobbins may miss this game, freeing up a whopping 17.7 touches—including 2.9 targets—that would need to find new homes in the Chargers' backfield. Gus Bus Edwards is the theoretical next man up, though Hassan Haskins and Kimani Vidal will be looking over his shoulders.

- Gus Edwards is averaging 10.7 PPR points and 14.6 touches per game across 38 career games where he handled 10 or more touches in Greg Roman's offense (max of 23 touches)

- Gus Edwards is averaging 13.2 PPR points and 17.7 touches per game in 18 career games that he handled 15 or more touches in Greg Roman's offense (max of 23 touches)

- He hasn't been terrific this year, averaging 3.25 yards per touch and 0.43 PPR points per touch

- Averaging 5.1 PPR points per game in 3 games this season where he handled double digit touches, handling 13.3 touches per game—including 0.3 targets/catches—for 47.3 scoreless scrimmage yards.

- Scored fewer than 6 PPR points in all 3 games.

- Has yet to reach 8 PPR points in a game this year.

🟡 ATL VS RB:
- Holding RBs to the 13th fewest PPR points per game, including the 15th fewest scrimmage yards and 4th fewest TDs from scrimmage

- Tough on the ground: Holding RBs to the 15th fewest rushing yards and 2nd fewest rushing TDs

- Vulnerable through the air: Allowing the 3rd most catches, 14th most receiving yards and 6th most receiving TDs per game

- Much better looking matchup at the individual level, where 9 RBs in the last 10 games have been able to score 15 or more PPR points against the Falcons, including 3 that scored more than 21

- Of course, if you remove all receiving stats, then NO RB in 11 games has been able to reach even just 14 points against Atlanta.

- Games played: 11
- RBs who handled 10 or more touches: 13
- RBs who scored 10 or more PPR points: 9

- Dolphins at Packers has a strong over/under of 47.5 points, tied for the 4th highest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. Both teams are sporting top 18 implied point totals of 22 or more, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points if the Dolphins can exceed expectations.

- The Packers have a strong implied point total of 25.5 points, tied for the 6th most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is an offense you want exposure to in your week 13 lineups.

- Boooms: Scored 14 or more PPR points in 6 of 11 games (54.5%), including a high of 31.5 points back in week 5, his only game of 20 or more

- Busts: Scored fewer than 10 PPR points in 5 of 11 games (45.5%), including 2 games under 5 points with a low of 2.5

🟡 LAC VS WR:
- Holding WRs to the 14th fewest PPR points per game, including the 6th fewest catches and 16th fewest yards

- That said, they ARE allowing the 8th most TDs

- 8 WRs in 11 games have scored 15 or more PPR points against the Chargers, all of which have been within the last 9 games.

- 3 WRs in the last 3 games have scored more than 25 PPR points against the Chargers.

- HIT: Calvin Austin, Xavier Worthy, Courtland Sutton, Chris Olave, Cedric Tillman, Calvin Ridley, Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins

- MISS: Davante Adams, George Pickens, Marvin Harrison, Zay Flowers",,4,LV,QB,"🟠 Aidan O'Connell

BOTTOM LINE: Aidan O'Connell is not a recommended QB 2 or streamer. I'd rather play the Chiefs defense than play Aidan O'Connell

🔴 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Raiders have a dangerously low implied point total of just 15 points, easily the FEWEST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're an offense to attack with the Chiefs defense, not an offense to put in your lineups.

- The Raiders are pathetic 12.5 point road underdogs, a dangerously wide spread that suggests a blowout loss and supremely negative game script that will force the Raiders into a pass-heavy approach if they fall behind. It puts rushing volume at risk for Raiders' ball carriers while raising the target potential of Raiders' pass catchers.

🟠 AIDAN O'CONNELL:
- Completed 27 of 40 passes for 227 yards, 1 TD and 1 INT (11.08 fantasy points) in his first start of the season in week 6.

- He's now averaging 14.6 fantasy points, 243.3 passing yards, 1.4 passing TDs (11 total), 0.8 INTs (6 total) and 0.1 rushing TDs (1 total) over 8 career games where he threw at least 31 passes.

- He's scored fewer than 15 fantasy poinits in 5 of those 8 games, including 2 turds under 10. 

- To be fair, he's also scored 17 or more points in the other 3 of 8 games, including 2 over 20 with a high of 25.9.

🟠 Averaging 8 fantasy points per game in 2 career games against the Chiefs.

- Scored 13.9 fantasy points in week 12 against the Chiefs last year, followed by 2.1 fantasy points in week 16.

🟡 KC VS QB:
- Allowing the 10th most fantasy points per game to QBs (17.43), though it's largely because they're allowing the 10th most QB rushing yards and 7th most QB rushing TDs.

- That said, through the air, they're holding QBs to the 14th fewest passing yards and 17th fewest passing TDs per game.

- 8 QBs in 11 games games have scored 16 or more fantasy points against the Chiefs, including EACH of the last 6 games.

- That said, if you take away all rushing stats, then just 4 QBs in 11 games were able to hit 15 fantasy points against the Chiefs

- HIT: Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow, Brock Purdy, Gardner Minshew, Baker Mayfield, Bo Nix, Josh Allen, Bryce Young

- MISS: Kirk Cousins, Justin Herbert, Derek Carr",,7,JAX,WR,"🟡 Devin Duvernay

BOTTOM LINE: Justin Herbert is a strong QB 1 option in this potentially high scoring game and great matchup.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- Chargers at Falcons has a solid over/under of 47.5 points, tied for the 4th highest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting top 16 implied totals of 23 or more points, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points. If I had to build a fantasy football lineup out of ONE game this week, Chargers at Falcons would be at or near the top of the list. You WANT exposure to this game.

- The Chargers have a solid implied point total of 24.5 points, tied for the 9th most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. You want exposure to this offense.

- The Chargers are narrow 1.5 point road favorites, suggesting a close game, neutral game script and a balanced offensive approach.

- HIT: Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes, Baker Mayfield, Geno Smith, Baker Mayfield, Cowboys QBs, Derek Carr, Bo Nix

- MISS: Justin Fields, Derek Carr, Andy Dalton",,5,ATL,TE,"🟢 Kyle Pitts

BOTTOM LINE: Kyle Pitts is a cautiously optimistic, boom or bust TE 1/2 with a decent chance of booming in this potentially high scoring game and mediocre matchup.

If I had to build a fantasy football lineup out of ONE game this week, Chargers at Falcons would be at or near the top of the list. You WANT exposure to this game.

- The Falcons have a mediocre implied point total of 23 points, the 16th ""most"" among all 32 teams on the week 13 slate.

- The Falcons are narrow 1.5 point home underdogs, suggesting neutral game script and a balanced offensive approach.

- That said, they ARE allowing the 9th most catches

- 4 TEs in 11 games have scored 10 or more PPR points against the Chargers

- HIT: Brock Bowers, Travis Kelce, Trey McBride, Mark Andrews

- MISS: David Njoku",,4,LV,RB,"🟠 Ameer Abdullah

BOTTOM LINE: Ameer Abdullah is (potentially) a last last LAST resort, volume based RB 3/flex in week 13 if Alexander Mattison AND Zamir White sit this one out. That said, there's almost NO optimism for him outside of volume with an impossible matchup and even worse game script.

🔴 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Raiders have a dangerously low implied point total of just 15 points, easily the FEWEST among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're an offense to attack with the Chiefs defense, not an offense to put in your lineups.

- The Raiders are pathetic 12.5 point road underdogs, a dangerously wide spread that suggests a blowout loss and supremely negative game script that will force the Raiders into a pass-heavy approach if they fall behind. It puts rushing volume at risk for Raiders' ball carriers while raising the target potential of Raiders' pass catchers.

🟠 AMEER ABDULLAH:
- One or both of Alexander Mattison and/or Zamir White may miss week 13 (or not), once again openeing up the backfield to 31 year old Ameer Abdullah and practice squad callup Sincere McCormick.

- In the same scenario last week, Abdullah was the fantasy-relevant option, handling 13 touches—including 5 catches on 6 targets—for 65 yards and 1 TD (17.5 PPR points) while McCormick handled just 5 touches—all carries—for 33 scoreless yards (3.3 PPR points)

- Entering the event, Ameer Abdullah was averaging just 10.7 PPR points per game across 26 career games where he handled at least 10 touches, averaging 14.2 touches per game—including 2.6 catches on 3.3 targets—for 63.4 scrimmage yards and 0.3 TDs (8 total)

- The 2015 2nd round pick from Nebraska scored fewer than 10 PPR points in 15 of those 26 games (57.7%)

- He scored 15 or more PPR points in just 4 of 26 games (15.4%) with a high of 23 points, his only game over 20.

- Averaging 12.3 PPR points and 17.9 touches per game over 10 career games where he handled at least 15 touches (scored more than 12 PPR points in just 3 of those 10 games)

🔴 KC VS RB:
- Suffocating RBs, holding them to the FEWEST PPR points per game, including the 2nd fewest touches, FEWEST scrimmage yards and 4th fewest TDs from scrimmage

- Impossible on the ground: Holding RBs to the FEWEST rushing yards and 10th fewest rushing TDs

- Tough through the air: Holding RBs to the 11th fewest catches, 4th fewest receiving yards and NO receiving TDs

- Just 1 RB in 11 games has been able to reach 14 PPR points against the Chiefs, and he topped out at 19.7.

BOTTOM LINE: Anthony Richardson is a perfectly fine QB 2 and streaming option with always-present QB 1 upside in this low(ish) scoring game but not scary matchup 

🟡 GAME SCRIPT:
- Colts at Patriots has a low over/under of 42.5 points, tied for the 4th lowest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting bottom 16 implied totals under 23 points, suggesting a slugfest that won't feature many fantasy points.

- The Patriots have a low point total of just 20 points, tied for the 8th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. Theoretically, they're more of an offense to target with the Colts' defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

- The Patriots are narrow 2.5 point home underdogs, suggesting mostly neutral game script and a balanced offensive approach.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Chiefs have a strong implied point total of 27.5 points, the 2nd most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. This is an offense you want exposure to in your week 13 lineups.

- The Chiefs are dominant 12.5 point home favorites, a wide spread that suggests a blowout win and supremely positive game script that *should* create a run-heavy approach as the Chiefs are trying to kill the clock in the 2nd half. It raises the potential rushing volume of Chiefs' ball carriers while potentially lessening the target potential for Chiefs' pass catchers.

🟠 NOAH GRAY:
- Making noise over the last 2 games, catching 8 of 9 targets for 89 yards and 4(!!!) touchdowns.

- Averaging 20.5 PPR points per game over the last 2 since scoring 18.3 in week 11 and 22.6 in week 12.

- BUT...4 touchdowns on 8 catches is wildly unsustainable, and Gray averaged just 4.6 PPR points and 2.3 targets per game over the first 9 games of the year. There's a good chance he's a risky trap.

- Still, he DOES have 9 targets in the last 2 games, putting him at least ON the radar in a great matchup.

- The Patriots have a low point total of just 20 points, tied for the 8th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. Theoretically, they're more of an offense to target with the Colts' defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

BOTTOM LINE: Geno Smith is a mediocre QB 2 and streamer option in week 13.

🟡 GAME SCRIPT:
- Seahawks at Jets has a low over/under of 41.5 points, tied for the 2nd lowest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting bottom 13 implied totals under 22 points, suggesting a snoozefest that won't feature many fantasy points.

- The Seahawks have a subpar point total of just 21.5 points, the 13th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate.

- The Seahawks are narrow 1.5 point road favorites, suggesting a close game, neutral game script and a balanced offensive approach.

🟢 GENO SMITH:
- Averaging 16.3 fantasy points per game after 11 games, including 36.8 passing attempts, 275.9 passing yards, 1.1 passing TDs (12 total), 1.1 INTs (12 total), 20.4 rushing yards and 0.2 rushing TDs (2 total)

- Scored 15 or more fantasy points in 7 of 11 gmaes (63.6%), including 3 games over 21 with a high of 22.56

🟡 NYJ VS QB:
- Technically allowing the 16th most fantasy points per game to QBs (16.64), but it's a bit misleading...

- For starters, they don't intercept the ball, just 0.18 per game, the 3rd lowest frequency in football.

- They also give up a ton of production to rushing QBs, allowing the 11th most rushing yards and MOST rushing TDs

- But they're top 3 in football when it comes to stamping out production in the passing game, holding QBs to the 3rd fewest passing yards and 2nd fewest passing TDs.

- Just 5 QBs in 11 games have been able to reach 14 fantasy points against the Jets.

- THAT SAID...The Jets are BLEEDING...All 5 of them have been within the last 6 games, and each of them scored at least 17 fantasy points, 4 of which scored more than 24 including an eruption of 30.08 from Anthony Richardson their last time out.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Jaguars have a low point total of just 19.5 points, tied for the 6th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Texans defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

BOTTOM LINE: Jayden Daniels is a comfortable QB 1 in this above-average matchup against a Titans defense that gets destroyed by rushing QBs

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Commanders have a strong implied point total of 25 points, tied for the 8th most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. You want exposure to this offense.

- Recovering from a recent slump where he scored fewer than 12 fantasy points in 2 of the last 3 games.

🟢 TEN VS QB:
- Technically allowing the 12th most fantasy points per game (17.17) to enemy QBs. BUT...

- It's largely because they get burned by rushing QBs, allowing the 7th most rushing yards and 3rd most rushing TDs.

- They're on the tougher side through the air, holding QBs to the FEWEST passing yards while allowing the 14th most passing TDs.

- 8 QBs in 11 games have been able to score 15 or more fantasy points against the Titans, including 3 that scored more than 21.

- BUT...if you remove all rushing stats, then just 4 QBs in 11 games were able to reach 15 fantasy points against the Titans.

- The Commanders are comfortable 5.5 point home favorites favorites, suggesting a positive game script and balanced offensive approach that *could* turn run-heavy if the Commanders are trying to milk the clock in the 2nd half.

🟡 BRIAN ROBINSON:

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Titans have a low point total of just 19.5 points, tied for the 6th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Commanders defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

BOTTOM LINE: Terry McLaurin is a boom or bust WR 2 with a nice implied point total but a dangerous matchup.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Commanders have a strong implied point total of 25 points, tied for the 8th most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. You want exposure to this offense.

- The Commanders are comfortable 5.5 point home favorites favorites, suggesting a positive game script and balanced offensive approach that *could* turn run-heavy if the Commanders are trying to milk the clock in the 2nd half.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Titans have a low point total of just 19.5 points, tied for the 6th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Commanders defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

- That said, they ARE holding WRs to the 14th fewest yards so...that's cool.

- 9 WRs in 12 games have scored 15 or more PPR points against the Commanders, including 6 that scored more than 20

- They've been tougher lately, however, as just 3 WRs in the last 8 games have been able to reach 15 PPR points

- Steelers at Bengals has a strong over/under of 47.5 points, tied for the 5th highest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. Both teams are sporting top 17 implied point totals of 22 or more, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points if the Steelers can exceed expectations.

- The Steelers have a mediocre implied point total of 22.5 points, tied for the 15th ""fewest"" among all 32 teams on the week 13 slate.

- The Steelers are narrow 2.5 point road underdogs, suggesting mostly neutral game script and a balanced offensive approach.

- HIT: Rashee Rice (RIP), Terry McLaurin, Diontae Johnson, Xavier Legette, Rashod Bateman, Zay Flowers, Cedric Tillman, DeVonta Smith, Jakobi Meyers, Tylan Wallace, Rashod Bateman, Ladd McConkey

- MISS: Zay Flowers",,15,SF,RB,"🔵 Jordan Mason

- Instantly enters the ""RB 2 with RB 1 upside"" conversation if anything happened to Christian McCaffrey, who Dr. Deepak Chona says is a re-injury risk for the rest of the season.

- BUT...it IS worth noting that rookie Isaac Guerendo has the momentum as of late, and BOTH of them have played exactly 5 snaps behind CMC, making it entirely unclear who's truly the RB 2 in San Francisco at the moment"

- Scored fewer than 15 fantasy points in 5 of 11 games (45.5%), including lows of 9.98 (week 4) and 6.76 (week 9)

🟡 MIN VS QB:
- Technically holding QBs to the 11th fewest fantasy points per game (15.29), but it's deceiving and you have to dig deeper here...

- For starters, the Vikings are intercepting the ball more than any other defense in football (1.45 times per game)

- 2nd, they're stamping out the QB rushing game, holding QBs to the FEWEST rushing yards and 13th fewest rushing TDs per game

- But through the air, Minnesota is actually ALLOWING the 5th most passing yards and 12th most passing TDs per game

- 6 QBs in 11 games have scored 15 or more fantasy points against the Vikings, including 3 that scored more than 24.

Bottom Line: Taysom Hill is the ultimate boom or bust ""TE"" in fantasy football, getting you 0s some weeks and 20s in others. Matchups don't matter for Taysom, as he's created his own position. He DOES have some added upside with Chris Olave, Rashid Shaheed, Bub Means AND Kendre Miller ALL on IR.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- Rams at Saints  has a strong over/under of 48.5 points, tied for the 2nd highest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting top 15 implied point totals of 23 or more points, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points. If I had to build a fantasy football lineup out of ONE game this week, Rams at Saints would be at or near the top of the list. You WANT exposure to this game.

- The Saints have a mediocre implied point total of 23 points, tied for the 15th most among all 32 teams on the week 13 slate.

- The Saints are narrow 2.5 point home underdogs, suggesting neutral game script and a balanced offensive approach.

- Taysom scored 14 or more PPR points in 3 of 7 games

- But also fewer than 8 PPR points in 4 of 7 games.",,13,LAR,WR,"🟡 Demarcus Robinson

🟡 MARQUEZ VALDES-SCANTLING:
- Technically averaging an absurd 21.3 PPR points per game over his last 2 games with the Saints...

- But he's doing it on just 3.5 targets and 2.5 catches per game for 98 yards and 1.5 TDs (3 total)

- Dude has 3 touchdowns on 5 catches in the last 2 games...

- That said, he IS still brand new to a team that currently has NO one to play WR (seriously...some dude named ""Kevin Austin"" led all Saints WRs in offensive snaps in week 11) and is the best bet in a week 13 shootout.

BOTTOM LINE: Deebo Samuel is a WR 3 with Brock Purdy under center, and a WR 4/flex with Brandon Allen under center. It's a tough matchup and a low implied point total either way.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- The 49ers have a low point total of just 19 points, tied for the 4th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Bills defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

- The 49ers are 6.5 point road underdogs, a wide enough spread to suggest negative game script and a possible pass heavy approach if the Niners fall behind early.

- 11 targets in EACH of the last 2 games with Purdy.

- Of course, the risk with Purdy is that he could get knocked out of the game at any time. If that happens, know that Jennings caught 5 of 7 targets for 40 scoreless yards (9 PPR points) in his first game with Brandon Allen

- Holding enemy QBs to the 9th fewest fantasy points per game (14.84), including the 15th fewest passing yards, 12th fewest rushing yards and 13th fewest rushing TDs

- That said, they ARE allowing the 14th most passing TDs per game

- 6 QBs in 11 games have scored 15 or more fantasy points against the Bills, including a high of 25.64 from Lamar Jackson in week 4 (to be fair, he's the ONLY QB to reach 18 points against Buffalo)

BOTTOM LINE: Alvin Kamara is a rock solid RB 1 any time he's on the football field, especially in this potentially high scoring game and a matchup that Saquon Barkley just blowtorched for 46.2 PPR points.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- Rams at Saints  has a strong over/under of 48.5 points, tied for the 2nd highest among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. BOTH teams are sporting top 15 implied point totals of 23 or more points, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points. If I had to build a fantasy football lineup out of ONE game this week, Rams at Saints would be at or near the top of the list. You WANT exposure to this game.

- The Saints have a mediocre implied point total of 23 points, tied for the 15th most among all 32 teams on the week 13 slate.

BOTTOM LINE: Amari Cooper is a tough-to-trust WR 4/flex until we see him play more than 51% of the snaps in Buffalo's offense.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Bills have a strong implied point total of 25.5 points, tied for the 5th most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. You want exposure to this offense.

- The Bills are comfortable 5.5 point home favorites favorites, suggesting a positive game script and balanced offensive approach that *could* turn run-heavy if the Bills are trying to milk the clock in the 2nd half.

🟡 AMARI COOPER:
- Averaging 8.5 PPR points per game after 3 games in a Bills uniform, including 3.3 targets, 2.3 catches, 41.3 yards and 0.3 TDs (1 total)

- Has yet to play more than 51% of the offensive snaps in a game with the Bills, but it HAS climbed with every week.

🟠 SF VS WR:
- Holding WRs to the 9th fewest PPR points per game, including the 8th fewest catches, 10th fewest yards, and 8th fewest TDs

- MISS: Marvin Harrison, DK Metcalf, DK Metcalf, Jayden Reed",,15,BUF,WR,"🟡 Curtis Samuel

BOTTOM LINE: Don't let the yellow dot trick you into doing something cute. Saquon Barkley is an ELITE, every week RB 1 as long as he's on the field. This is just a tough matchup so we might see more of a floor than ceiling game.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:

BOTTOM LINE: Brock Purdy is a high risk QB play in week 13. He's more of a higher end QB 2 than his usual back end QB 1. I personally am looking for an alternative streaming option in my leagues where I roster Brock Purdy.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- The 49ers have a low point total of just 19.5 points, tied for the 4th fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Bills defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

- The 49ers are 5.5 point road underdogs, a wide enough spread to suggest negative game script and a possible pass heavy approach if the Niners fall behind early.

🟢⚠️ BROCK PURDY:
- Dealing with a shoulder injury that kept him out of week 12 and has him looking questionable at best for week 13. Dr. Jesse Morse says ""I don't trust himi this week. Please be careful starting him,"" suggesting he's an easy re-injury risk and/or could be dealing with limited effectiveness. Vegas sportsbooks seem to agree, projecting the 49ers for just 19.5 points this week, an abnormally low number for when Purdy is under center.

- Purdy HAS been ballin' over his last 5 games, averaging 21.9 fantasy points per game, including 29.8 pass attempts, 247.8 passing yards, 1.4 passing TDs (7 total), 0.8 INTs (4 total), 31.8 rushing yards and 0.8 rushing TDs (4 total)

🟡 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Broncos have a mediocre implied point total of 23.5 points, the 14th most among all 32 teams on the week 13 slate.

- The Broncos are comfortable 5.5 point home favorites favorites, suggesting a positive game script and balanced offensive approach that *could* turn run-heavy if the Broncos are trying to milk the clock in the 2nd half.

🟠 JAVONTE WILLIAMS:
- Averaging 10.4 PPR points per game after 12 wildly unpredictable games, handling 13.1 touches per game—including 3.1 catches on 4.0 targets—for 58.4 scrimmage yards and 0.3 TDs (3 total)

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,BAL,RB,"🟡 Derrick Henry

BOTTOM LINE: Don't let the yellow dot trick you into doing something cute. Derrick Henry is an ELITE, every week RB 1 as long as he's on the field (and the Ravens are favored). This is just a tough matchup so we *might* not see the crazy ceiling in week 13.

🟢 GAME SCRIPT:
- Eagles at Ravens has a mouthwatering over/under of 51.5 points, easily the HIGHEST among all 16 games on the full week 13 slate. Both teams are sporting top 11 implied point totals above 24 points, suggesting a possible shootout and plenty of fantasy football points. If I had to build a fantasy football lineup out of ONE game this week, Eagles at Ravens would THE game. You want exposure to this game.

- The Ravens have a strong implied point total of 27.25 points, the 3rd most among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. You want exposure to this offense.

- The Ravens are 3 point home favorites, suggesting a neutral-positive game script and balanced offensive approach.

🟠 GAME SCRIPT:
- The Browns have a low point total of just 18 points, the 3rd fewest among all 32 teams on the full week 13 slate. They're more of an offense to target with the Broncos defense than one to invest heavily in in your week 13 lineups.

- The Browns are 5.5 point road underdogs, a wide enough spread to suggest negative game script and a possible pass heavy approach if the Browns fall behind early.
