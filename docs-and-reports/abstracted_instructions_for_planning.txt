Here are some more general instructions:


The current patterns, conventions, and configuration for this app (fastapi-k8-proto) should be maintained at all cost.

The instructions should break the process down in to discrete, testable steps.

Each step should have a clear goal, a clear set of actions to be performed by the ai agent, and a strategy for confirming that the actions were sucessfull.

In cases where there are code edits, the ai agent is to perform the changes.

In cases where there are commands to be run, the ai agent is to run them in the chat window context and parse the output for errors and other actionable information.

Be wary of over engineering things. If there is a simple way to do something that gets 80% of the value with 20% the complexity, opt for that implementation.




For the plan you create, please create a md document in the root of the project and put the instructions there for safe keeping
