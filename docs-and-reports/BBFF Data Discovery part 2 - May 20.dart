  Okay, good. Yeah, we're moving in this thing. We've got data. There it's a heatmap. And heatmap sheet. There's the stuff.  Okay, so starting at the beginning, so the game script for a weekly heatmap is unique to each game, right?  So Eagles at Ravens, and all the players in the heatmap have that same game script in their little blurb with the player summary.

0:54 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Which one did you pop? Yes. Which one did you pop open? Let me share my screen.

0:59 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  That was what I was doing.

1:01 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  But to answer your question, yes, all the players, so, all of the players on that team will have the same game script.  Right, okay. Not necessarily in the game, because each team will have their own script of how things will likely go.  You might find instances where, if there's something about the script that tells me the game is going to be particularly run-heavy or pass-heavy, you might find instances where there's a little addition for running backs on that team that says, expect low or limited rushing volume, or expect a ton of rushing volume.  And on the flip side, for the pass catchers, the wide receivers and tight ends, it might say, expect raised passing volume or lessened passing volume.  But for the most part, the game script is going to be the same for every player on the same team, because ultimately what it's telling you is, here is how this game should go for the Chicago Bears, the Detroit Lions, the Giants, the Cowboys, and then there should be a little thing that says, this is basically says, this is good news or bad news for the running backs, this is good news or bad news for the wide receivers, or it's just neutral, right?  Most of these games are going, it's like a, it's not good, it's not bad, it's just mediocre average. Sure.  Which is upholed enough.

2:37 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  And so, two thoughts. Do you create individual game scripts per team, or is it per game? Like is there, like if the Bears, so like I'm just looking at this, if we have Eagles at Ravens, is it pertinent to say, like that team is the Philadelphia, so.  If there's information pertinent to the Eagles in that game script for that player, since they're on the Eagles, do you end up customizing the game script for that specific team?  Or is that going to be the same for that game across both teams for all of the players on either of those teams?

3:26 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  More the team than the game. So if you scroll, where is that game? That's game 14. So scroll down a little bit just so I can see the number, sorry, on the whole sheet.  So yeah, just down to the game. There we go. So the Eagles Ravens. So how do I explain this?  Because when I'm building, if I'm sitting at my desk, I'm building this. The thing that pops out to me is all the green in that game, right?  You see the over-under, you see the... Yep. The... The... The fact that the over-under is green and the implied point totals are green, that already tells me that this game is going to be a shootout.  There's going to be a lot of points. There's going to be a lot of yards. There's going to be touchdowns.  I want players on both teams. So the first thing I'll mention as far as the game script goes in this game is there's going to be a lot of points.  You want exposure to this game on both teams. You want Eagles. You want Ravens. You want both. But then from there, I will dig into the team level.  So I'll create the game script for the Eagles, right? The Eagles are three-point underdogs. Ultimately, this is a very mediocre thing for the Eagles in this particular example.  They're not a team to stay away from. In fact, I'm not even sure it's relevant to dig into... I think...  The story here that I would want to tell with that game is that it's going to be a shootout and there's going to be a lot of points.  And you want exposure to it. And that's basically it. I don't think there's anything else that's relevant about the game script.  I mean, you would say, basically, I want exposure to anybody in the game. Any exposure that I can get, that's what I want.  But where it gets tricky from a team, where I want to get granular at the team level, would be, I mean, here's an extreme example.  If you look up at game number four, Raiders Chiefs, that is where I want to get granular at the team level, because that script tells two very different stories.  Like, the story for the Chiefs is going to be way different than the story for the Raiders. If you look at the game literally right underneath that, Chargers-Falcons, there's only one and a half points that separates those two teams.  That game's about as, they call it neutral game script, as it gets. That one, there's not really an individual story to tell about the Chargers or the Falcons.  More so, hey, this game is going to be a higher scoring game. Both teams should score a fair amount of points.  You want exposure to this game on either side. It really doesn't matter which one. Maybe a slight lean towards the Chargers simply because they're favored.  So I don't know if that helps or makes it more tricky because there's times where I get really specific at the team level, but a lot of times it's more so about just like, hey, this game is going to be high scoring, low scoring, et cetera.  Cool.

6:31 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  Let me mirror that back to you just to make sure I'm understanding.

6:34 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Yeah.

6:35 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  So going back to Eagles Ravens, there's a high expected point value.

6:42 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Yep.

6:43 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  And they're both really pretty green with a pretty small spread. I you have lots of points in the game, lots of action, a good game.  And all of the players on the offense and the defense. Both in terms of running and passing, are all going to get lots of action.  So play those good players on both of those teams to maximize the fantasy points. For the Chiefs and the Raiders, we're looking at the Raiders having a smaller relative implied point value for that game.  Meaning they're going to have to take risks to catch up, meaning they're going to be passing more. And so if it makes sense to utilize the players that are more heavy on the passing plays on the Raiders, you've got to find the ones that are good, right?  They're awesome on that team that are going to be utilized in that game. For the past, and then likewise for the Chiefs, they're probably  They're probably going to be running more because they don't need to take the risk because they're going to be doing better anyway.  So play the players on the Chiefs that are going be more associated with the running plays.

8:16 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  With one slight adjustment, I would say there. I think you nailed the Eagles and the Ravens. That game was just, you have Eagles and you have Ravens, put them in.  On the Raiders, you nailed it. You want players from the passing game there. And you see it all the time.  There's guys that will, let's just say they average eight targets. Do you know what a target is? The ball was thrown at them in a game.  Let's say they average eight targets per game. If they're 14-point underdogs, they're probably going to see more like 11, 12 targets per game.  And ultimately in fantasy football, volume is what you want. And by the It also tells, while that says, hey, get the pass catchers in there, it also tells a negative story for Raiders running backs.  Because you might have a running back that averages 20 carries per game, but if the Raiders have to abandon the run, suddenly that guy drops down to 10, 11, 12 carries and doesn't score any points.  So, I don't know why I just rehashed that. You nailed it. The one adjustment I would make there is, the Chiefs, when we look at the Chiefs, yes, because they're 14-point favorites or 13.5-point favorites, they will theoretically be running the ball in the second half because they're just trying to milk the clock and finish the game.  However, the more important number is the implied, the most important number on this whole sheet for every team is going to be the implied point total.  So that, because it tells us the Chiefs... They're expected to score 27 and a half. I don't know. That might be the high among all 32 teams on here, or at least it's going to be up there.  It's probably like top five. That basically tells us if you have Kansas City Chiefs on your roster, put them in your lineup, even if they're the quarterback, the wide receiver, the tight end.  They'll probably be running the ball in the second half, but don't stay away from their pass catchers because they're going to score a lot of points.  You want somebody on that team in case they score a touchdown. So while the Raiders can tell the story of stay away from the running back, the Chiefs are going to score so many points that you want basically anybody to get in there.  So moving forward, the number one most important thing in that column is the implied point, or in that area of the heat map is the implied point total.  If they have a high implied point total, it's all systems go for all of them. Running back, quarterback, wide receiver, tight end.  Gotcha. Yep. Perfect. Yep.

11:03 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  This is great. So just from this first level or like high level game stats, we've already got a lot of good information that we can go into.
  ACTION ITEM: Create prompts & prototype output for first couple sentences of game scripts using heatmap data - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/-b9XeZoUygshELGasEZL1hnjHfaZ6uMQ?timestamp=664.9999  Essentially what I'm seeing is like the first two sentences in the game script. So like the first sentence would be something like, it would cover details according to both teams maybe, and like the total implied points, I'm sorry, the total projected points for that game.  Like if it's really high, that would be notable. Like this is going to be a shootout. This is going to be an exciting game.  Throw your players in.

11:44 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  There's some rare occasions where you'll see a high over under the total points. Like you might see, let's just say 47.  I'll bet you there's one in here somewhere. Dolphins Packers is kind of... Getting along the lines of what I was about to mention, you'll see a high over-under where it's 47 and half, but one team is expected to score a ton, and the other team is expected to score a little.  So there are some scenarios where it's like the over-under doesn't tell the whole story, and you have to look at the implied point totals, but yeah.

12:20 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  Yeah, well, that's kind of what I was thinking, like, to cover discrepancies in the implied points, like with Chiefs and Raiders, like the second sentence would come in and say, would summarize what you were saying about the Raiders passing game is going to be very active.  for this game, and the Chiefs are projected to score a lot of points, so throw all of your players in for the Chiefs, and so that would kind of...  Add color to, like, 40, I guess, I don't know, what's an average total.

13:06 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Look at the white, the white ones down there are pretty, at 44 and a half, like, 44-ish is probably about, like, that'd probably be the, wait, I always screw these two up, median?  No, mean. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah. It'd probably be, that'd probably be right in the middle. Once you start getting above 44, it starts getting a little higher, and lower than that is lower, obviously.
  ACTION ITEM: Analyze full season of heatmaps to extract statistical info (mean, std dev) for game metrics - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/-b9XeZoUygshELGasEZL1hnjHfaZ6uMQ?timestamp=802.9999  Sure. Okay.

13:33 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  Just as a note, if you can send me, like, an entire season of heat maps, I can collate that data and get, like, really good statistical information out of that.

13:46 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  I was just thinking about that, where we could actually define, like, find lines in the sand to say, this is, this is defined as a high-scoring game, this is a low, that sort of thing.  Yeah. was just thinking about that. And so, where.

14:00 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  Where I would use that information is, you know, if the total projected points for a game is within, you know, half a standard deviation of the mean, then it's an average game.  And if it's above or below by a standard deviation, then it's either a very high scoring game or a low scoring game, respectively.  That information is really good. That'll be good to put into the prompt.

14:36 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  The good part is, is it's mostly consistent throughout. Like, sure, you're going to have the occasional outlier where a team is expected to score like 30 points or something.  But most of the time, the over-unders are going to land in the 40s. The implied point totals are going to land in the 20s.  It's going to be pretty consistent across 17 weeks. So I think we'll be able to find some nice. Lines in the sand, as I keep saying.  Sweet.

15:04 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  And so, yeah, I'm thinking, so first sentence is essentially talking about the game as a whole. So, like, the total projected points.  getting, you know, is it going to be a high-scoring game or a low-scoring game? And then the second sentence in the game script is going to highlight how much of a spread there is between the implied points for each of those teams.  And not necessarily saying that spread in the game summary, but saying what insight can be derived from that. Meaning the passing heavy on the Raiders and the, you know, the high implied points for the Chiefs, meaning play all of your Chiefs players.  Yep. Yep. Um, okay, so that's, that's what I would think of as like the first two sentences.

16:06 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Yeah, I would say, go ahead.

16:09 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  No, that's, that's, I wanted to, I wanted to kind of, uh, run that through and, and, uh, see how that lands.  Like, does that make sense in terms of your, your process?

16:22 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Yeah, I would say, if I'm thinking about, okay, let me just think for a second. If I'm thinking about sitting down and starting this from scratch, and I just, I put all the game information in, the first thing that I would look at for probably every team is their implied total, right?  Are they a high scoring team, a low scoring team, or a mediocre team? That'd be my first sentence. Like, hey, the Lions are expected to score 26 or 28 and a half.  Yeah, that's probably the top. Uh, or even down at game number 10. The commanders are expected to score 25 and a half.  That's an above average spread. Meaning, that's a team that, just generally speaking, you want to have exposure to in any capacity.  Quarterback, running back, wide receiver, tight end. The next thing I would look at is the spread. And I would say, by the way, the Commanders are six and a half point favorites.  That's not astronomical, but it is positive enough of a game script that I would expect a run-heavy approach, or a better way to put that is, there's no reason to be worried that the running backs won't get rushing volume.  Because they're favored, they'll be trying to kill the clock. Now, Eddie, where things might get a little bit tricky, now that I'm talking through this out loud, is the Commanders are actually a perfect example.  They have two running backs that are good at two very different things, depending on how the game's going. If they're winning, and they can run the ball, they usually go to Brian Robinson.  They just hand it to them and let them run, but if they're losing and they need to throw the ball, they have Austin Eckler, who's really good at catching passes.  Gotcha. This is where things get a little bit tricky, and this is where, like, I don't know if it'll be able to identify that or if I have to go in, which would be fine, but that's where I would, in this scenario, I would say this game, because the Commanders are six and a half point favorites, they should win relatively easily.  This should be a game where Brian Robinson is good for 15-plus carries. Austin Eckler probably won't be as involved.  If this was any other week and the Commanders were in a neutral game or even expected to lose, it would be the reverse of that.  So that might be the sort of thing where my manual, like, interjection has to come into play. I'm getting besides the point here.  This is good. To answer your question, I would go implied point total. First of all, I just want to know if they're going to score points, right?  If they have, let's just say, 23 or higher implied total, that's pretty good. You want those guys in your lineup.  22 is about average. 21 or lower, you want to start to avoid those players, except for those game script specific scenarios where volume comes into play.  But so I would start with the implied total. And then from there, I look at the spread and see if the spread tells a story.  So that would be like the second sentence. I don't know if that answers your question or if I'm making it really confusing.  No, this is great.

19:36 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  And the more nuanced details about, like you were saying, the commanders, that's also super important because I would say those kinds of details might come in, you know, on maybe the third or fourth sentence in the game script, where now that we're looking at, now that we have that.  All information about the implied point totals. We know, like you said, the commanders are going to win pretty handily, but how are they going to win and which players are going to get the most action based on...

20:11 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  are they going to win? That's a question that I want to answer. love that. Yep, I love it.

20:16 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  And so now we're going to say which players in that winning game script, given that implied point total, are going to be the most likely to get the most action.  And thus, score the most points. So then we can go in and say, now we have all of this player data, and if we know, if we can say, here's a running back that wants to run, and here's a running back, or I forget exactly who the players were, what their roles were, but here's a player that we know is going to get a lot of action.  And we know that based on all of these odds and this historical information about that player, we can say in the game script, based on the fact that the command...  These are going to be running heavy in this particular game, and we think they're going to win. Here's the player that you need to play.  That's the nut of this that we're going to extract. And then I need to generalize that so that we can say more specifically, okay, the Titans are going to be passing heavy because they have a lower projected point total.

21:23 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  So if we have – Well, they're going to – so just to clarify, though, they'll be more passing heavy not because of the lower implied total but because of the spread.  The spread tells us that they're expected to lose and lose handedly, so they're going to have to throw to keep up.  Yep. Perfect.

21:43 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  And given that, instead of – the next sort of layer down in that analysis of the Titans would be if you wanted to play a Titans player, say that that's – like, remind me how it works on  On your league, you have a certain number of players throughout the entire season from given teams. So say you had two players from the Titans, and you're like, , which one do I play?  It's going to be the one that's better at catching passes or whatever associated with that player that's better relative to passing.  And so that's the next layer of analysis that I would want to imbue into this game script. Like, which players are – so if we're going to be running heavy or passing heavy, which players are specific to that team that are good at those things for this game?

22:38 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Yep. That's perfect. And there's going to be a basic – there's going to be a general rule there where 99% of the time, any time – if it's going be pass heavy, it's going to be wide receivers and tight ends.  But there are occasional running backs, and we're talking probably less than 10%, but there are Or occasional running backs that they thrive in the passing game.  It's rare. It's like Charizard in a sea full of Charmander. That was a weird thing, but it does exist.  And the number one that comes to mind, the New Orleans Saints have a running back named Alvin Kamara. He butters his bread off of catching passes.  He's a terrific runner, but the fantasy football value comes from catching passes. So the Raiders are 13.5 point underdogs.  That's bad news for their running backs. They don't have any running backs that can do anything with that. That's bad.  You should avoid Raiders running backs there. The Saints, though, it's one of those rare scenarios where that could actually be a good thing for Alvin Kamara.  So we can definitely get to those. As I was talking through that, I just thought of one definition that might help.  And if not, you can feel free to ignore this, but the implied point total helps us identify. Where touchdowns are going to come from, which are important in fantasy football, the spread helps us identify where volume is going to come from.  I don't know if that is going to be helpful moving forward. Yeah, definitely.

24:20 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  So let's say that one more time. So the total number of points indicates a higher number of touchdowns, and the spread implies a higher volume for the specific players that are relevant to that game.

24:41 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Right. So, yep, the total will tell us which teams are going to score. And in fantasy football, you get six points every time one of your guys scores a touchdown, right?  So if you have somebody on the Detroit Lions who have a 28 and a half point total, that suggests the Lions are going to score.  28 points, that's four touchdowns. You throw one of your Detroit Lions in there, you hope that you get, you have a better chance of getting a touchdown out of a Lion than if you put a Bear in there.  Yeah. So your implied total is going to help you identify the touchdown possibility or probability or projection, and the spread is going to tell the story of which players on those teams are or are not going to get the volume, if that makes sense.  I have no idea if I'm explaining that in a way that's helpful or not.

25:35 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  So it makes sense. So maybe let's go through a couple of examples of how that spread indicates specifically which players you might play.  So like Lions and Bears as a big spread. Yep.

25:50 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  And that's a good, I'm glad you just said that because that's one thing to note is that a lot of these where it's like, let's say the spread is less than four.  Anything. Anything. That's three and a half, two and a half, one and a half. As far as the spread goes, that can almost be ignored.  Those small spreads aren't wide enough to tell any kind of story about volume. But those bigger ones, actually, I'm glad we're talking about this.  We can literally ignore the small spreads. They don't tell us much. The big spreads are the ones that tell us a story about volume.  So you brought up the Bears-Lions. Lions heavily favored. They're more than two scores to the good in this case, right, nine and a half.  So the Bears would have to score a touchdown and a field goal to keep up. That tells us it's the same thing as Raiders Chiefs.  The Lions are going to be able to basically do whatever they want, run the ball, throw the ball. They'll be looking to run the ball in the second half.  If you have Detroit Lions, put them in the game because they're going to score a lot of touchdowns. It's going to come from a lot of different places.  The Bears, though, A, you look at their implied points. They're not going to score a lot of points. Right off the bat, you shouldn't be going out of your way to put Chicago Bears into your lineup.  It doesn't look like it's going to go well for them. That's what the implied point total tells us right off the bat.  But then you look at the spread and you say, oh, wow, they're two-score underdogs. I want nothing to do with the running back because they're going to abandon the run.  They're not going to be running the football. They have to throw the football to keep up. They aren't an offense that has one of those pass-catching backs.  So you can, in this scenario, you can ignore Chicago running backs. They would be placed in column D here because it sets up very poorly for them.  But if you need somebody who can rack up catches and yards, because the majority of people who play fantasy football, they play in what's called a PPR league.  And that means points per reception. Every single time a guy catches a pass, you get one point. So while the Bears might not score a lot of touchdowns, if they have a wide receiver that catches eight passes for 120 yards, there's value to that.  That's a 20-point game. Yeah. So the spread tells us from a volume standpoint, there won't be any for the running backs, but there will be for the wide receivers and the tight ends because the Bears might average 30 passes per game.  But in this game, because they're heavy underdogs, they're probably going to have to throw 40 passes a game, which means their pass catchers have a slightly elevated projection of volume.  Yep. Perfect. Does that make sense? Yeah. That's great. Okay. So just to put a bow on that story, if you're investing in Bears in this particular week, you're going into this knowing you're not looking...  You're not expecting touchdowns, you're expecting catches. And catches come from wide receiver tight ends, not from running backs. Gotcha.  Yep.

29:10 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  And so, say it were, I guess it really doesn't, the complementary situation doesn't necessarily apply. Why? Because it's only the case when the team has a higher implied points that they're going to be using the running plays more.  Meaning, there's never going to be that spread value that says, oh, they're not going to be passing. On the high end with the Lions, that just means they're going to be passing and running.

29:44 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  It means that they're probably going to build up, in this game, they're probably going to build up a really nice lead in the first half, doing whatever they want, running and passing.  But once they get into the fourth quarter, they're going to put the ball in the belly of their running back, and they will have...  A ton of rushing attempts, but by that point, they'll have already scored close to 30 points, so if you used a wide receiver, you hopefully got a touchdown out of that.  So it's like, the trump card is always going to be an implied point total. If they have 28 plus, it doesn't matter.  You want them in there because there's a good chance you're going to get a touchdown out of it. I don't think there is.  There's definitely a spread number where you want to start avoiding running backs, but there's not a spread number where you would avoid wide receivers and tight ends.

30:41 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  Gotcha. Yeah, that's kind of what I was getting for. Yeah, good. Yeah, perfect. Okay, that's great. Let's see. What else?  What time is it? I actually have to go pretty soon. I've got to have a hard stop. At Five Pill, this was excellent.  I know it kind of feels like we're going really deep and getting small pieces of this, but all the information that you gave me today, I think, is going to be really good at getting those first couple of sentences of the game script.  And I can go and do that now. So I think what I'll probably do in this prototyping is use this heat map and try and have my generalized rules reproduce the game scripts or similar projections for the game scripts that you've already got in here.
  ACTION ITEM: Use AI to compare generated game scripts vs existing ones, identify correct & wonky results - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/-b9XeZoUygshELGasEZL1hnjHfaZ6uMQ?timestamp=1888.9999  So what I'll do is go and write the prompts, generalize them, and then probably use AI to compare them and see which ones come up.  And which ones will be correct and which ones come up with wonky results. Sure. And that's what I'll share with you on Friday.  What's today? Tuesday. Yeah, probably Friday. How does that hit you?

32:22 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Yeah, that's fine. That's good. I know you've got to hop in like five minutes or even sooner. Would it help if I walked through really quickly exactly what my eyes are looking for when I look at over, under, spread, and implied total?  Yeah, let's go for it. Okay. So right off the top of my head, the order of importance would be the reverse.  Like implied point total is number one, spread is number two. Over, under can be ignored a lot of times.  Bears, okay, that first, that first one, Bears, Lions, I would ignore that. Okay, let me, here, here's a better.  Over, under, I'm basically looking at the color of the box, and if the color of the box matches the color of the implied point totals for both teams, then it's noteworthy.  Bears-Lions doesn't qualify, right, because the Bears are red and the over-under box is green. But the next game, Giants-Cowboys, this one actually does tell a story.  It's going to be, basically it's saying the Giants aren't going to score a lot of points, the Cowboys aren't going to score a lot of points, this game is not going to have a lot of points.  Like, there's no reason to be trying to get Giants and Cowboys in your lineup. Dolphins-Packers doesn't qualify, because there's red in there.  Chargers-Falcons, that game does qualify, because both the over-under and the implied total is green. That hints at a shootout, that hints at a lot of touchdowns.  It's a game we want exposure to. So my point is, when you're looking at over-under, I ignore most of the boxes unless you get three reds or three greens.  Sure. Does that make sense? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Now, the spread we talked about, I ignore most of the boxes.  Anything one, one and a half, two, two and a half, three and a half. Even four, four and a half, it's still pretty neutral.  There's positive game script, neutral game script, and negative game script. Once you start getting to five, five and a half, that's where it starts to become a little bit more heavily favored.  But even still, I'd say six and a half, six and six and a half is the number where I would start saying, watch out for, if they're six plus point underdogs, watch out for the running backs.  The running backs are a trap. You don't want to go for the running backs. You do want to go for the pass catchers.

  Sure.

35:05 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  An implied point total is, I'm just looking which teams are going to score a lot, which teams are going to score a little bit.  Anything 23 and over, that's a team that you want exposure to. Under 20, you almost want to avoid, unless the spread tells a story of volume.  Gotcha.

35:28 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  Yeah, like in Lions and Bears, Bears are probably going to be doing a lot of passing.

35:32 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Yep, so that tells a story of volume for pass catchers, but the game right under that, Giants are supposed to score just 17, and it's going to be a close game, meaning both teams are basically just not going to go anywhere.  It's just going to be ugly. There's no reason to expect a ton of volume for either team. Gotcha. Yep.  Love it.

35:51 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  This is great. It's fun to get into the details. I love this.

35:55 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Yeah, I hope it helps. I never know if I'm explaining it well or not. It's like it's one of those things.  Like, I know exactly what I'm thinking and how I go, but is it, like, coming out of my mouth the right way, you know?  No, it's great.

36:06 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  I'm definitely tracking. Let's meet again on Friday, and I will, by then, have a good sense of the prototyping for the prompts that will analyze each of those pieces of information as we were discussing.  And I will be able to have prototype output for those game scripts, at least in the first couple of sentences, and then we'll optimize it from there.  And I'm sure that will give us a lot to talk about on Friday.

36:47 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Sounds good, man.

36:49 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  One thing to note is that, you know, we started this, by the time Friday rolls around, it'll have been two weeks.  And given the original milestone, was to have essentially this heat map essentially reproduced. We're not really going to make that, but I think we're on a really good path.

37:14 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  Yeah, agree. Yeah, go ahead.

37:17 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  We can kind of reevaluate that on Friday and reset the timeline. How does that feel? Yeah, no, that's good.

37:26 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  I like that we're taking time to get piece by piece correct instead of trying to do it all and then coming backwards, right?  Because when we do it like this, it feels like the next step, we're going to be closer and closer to nailing the game script.  And once the game script's nailed, then we just move on to the next piece. So I'm totally fine with how it's going for sure.  Awesome.

37:50 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  Yeah, that's good to check in. Maybe we'll try and pull Ethan into the conversation on Friday so that he has all that context as well.  I'm going to talk. Today, the most important thing is that you still have confidence in the project and that you think we're going down the right path in terms of how we're going to represent your knowledge in this system.  And, yeah, I think it really there's a lot going on and you go really deep into these into this data.  And so all of that information, all of those processes and all of that knowledge has to get captured into the prompting.  And it's going to be it's going to be good. I have a high confidence at this point.

38:38 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  I do, too, man. I especially once you came back to me with DraftKings, like I thought it couldn't be done.  And you're like, dude, watch this. Hold my. So, yeah, I got a high degree of confidence. And you're asking really good questions that help me realize, OK, once you go back and do your thing.  There's a lot of times we talk. During the sales process, I'm like, how in the hell can they possibly get this in there?  And a lot of the questions you're asking make me think, okay, I don't know how he's going to do it.  I don't know what in the world he's going to do, but he's going to do it. So, yeah, we're good.

39:13 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  It's just a process of extracting and generalizing the way you're analyzing this stuff. And so we'll have to iterate.  Like, I'm sure I'll get to a generalization and then run all this through this data with the new prompts.  And then we'll have to go and sort of catch the edge cases and optimize the things that don't quite fit how I've generalized it.  And that'll be super helpful.

39:42 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  And that's why I think it's actually really helpful for us to go through this piece by piece, just one little chunk at a time.  Because instead of me, like, what I don't want to do is go have to read, like, 250 player profiles right off the bat.  Instead, it's like, can I read all 32 game summaries and identify those edge cases? And like, oh, this one.  So, and the other thing I just wanted to say, Eddie, in terms of like having confidence in the project, I don't get the sense from you that you're rushing through this, like just trying to like get it done, which is really important to me because I feel like you're taking your time to make sure we get it right, which, you know, small business owner, I'm going to invest the money.  want to make sure that somebody is like taking it seriously and getting it right. So, yeah. Oh, last thing I forgot to tell you.  I shared, you should have an email from me. I shared all of last year's key maps. You should be able to access every single one of those to come up with baselines for over, under, spread, implied, total.
  ACTION ITEM: Send meeting invite for Friday to discuss prototype results - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/-b9XeZoUygshELGasEZL1hnjHfaZ6uMQ?timestamp=2433.9999  Awesome.

40:36 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  That should be a ton of data for doing this.

40:40 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  So that's great. Thank you. Yep, yep, yep. Cool, man. I got nothing else. Yeah, I'll send you an invite for Friday and we'll get after it.

40:48 - Eddie Kemper (getsmartscalingai.com)
  Sounds good, brother.

40:50 - Mikey Henninger (Basement Brewed Fantasy Football)
  All right. Have good few days. Yep, thank you. Talk soon. Bye-bye.
