Timeline: TBD
​
Objectives and Key Results:
​
A website where Mikey can search for a player summary
This is likely just an integration of search on the heat map page
simple search bar
displays player summary
—> this needs refinement. need to figure out how this UX relates to the UX in the heat map. Is this just an integrated search / edit feature?
Will become more clear as we progress through the phases
​
