In PPR (Points Per Reception) fantasy football, players earn points based on their statistical performance. Here's how points are typically calculated for each position and play type:
Quarterbacks

Passing yards: 1 point per 25 yards (some leagues use 1 per 20)
Passing touchdowns: 4 or 6 points (varies by league)
Interceptions: -2 points
Rushing yards: 1 point per 10 yards
Rushing touchdowns: 6 points
Fumbles lost: -2 points

Running Backs and Wide Receivers

Rushing yards: 1 point per 10 yards
Rushing touchdowns: 6 points
Receiving yards: 1 point per 10 yards
Receiving touchdowns: 6 points
Receptions: 1 point each (this is the key PPR component)
Fumbles lost: -2 points

Tight Ends
Same scoring as running backs and wide receivers, including the crucial 1 point per reception that makes PPR leagues favor pass-catching players.
